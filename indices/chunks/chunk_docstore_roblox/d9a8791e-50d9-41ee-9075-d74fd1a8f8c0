Mix effect: mix effect accounts for the fact that each segment may intrinsically have a\n\nrate (DAU/MAU ratio) that's lower or higher than the initial global baseline. The mix effect is positive if the slice\u2019s DAU/MAU is low and its volume decreased, or if the slice\u2019s DAU/MAU is high and its volume increased.\n\n3. DAU/MAU effect (Rate effect): DAU/MAU effect assumes the slice\u2019s volume (MAU) did not change, and the additional DAU purely comes from the DAU/MAU change of this slice. The DAU/MAU effect is positive if the slice\u2019s DAU/MAU increased.\n\nWhile the volume effect is more important for sum-type target metrics and the mix effect is more important for ratio/average-type metrics, SliceFinder will return all three effects and sum them to yield the total contribution of the slice. The quantification of the contribution from slices helps the user prioritize their response, and the decoupling of rate and volume provides additional valuable information for the user and guides them to the appropriate course of action.\n\nFurther decomposition into subfactors:\n\nThe three effects mentioned above can be further decomposed into any number of subfactors, providing more precise guidance for the user. This is especially useful when a target metric is handled by multiple orgs. For example, to root-cause week-over-week global revenue change, the user can provide the formula for decomposition (e.g. \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc48 \u2217 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc48/\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc48 \u2217 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc52/\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc48) and specify the weight factor (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc48). SliceFinder would first decompose the total contribution of each slice into volume effect, mix effect, and rate effect, then further decompose each effect according to the user-provided formula (Figure 7). The second decomposition uses the following formula to convert the multiplicative relationship to an additive relationship:", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
