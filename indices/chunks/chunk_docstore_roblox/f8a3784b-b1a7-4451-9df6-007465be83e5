Milestone Duration\" that compares the average flow duration in seconds over a period of time for streaming-enabled and streaming-disabled scenarios. The x-axis represents the date range from April 1, 2023, to June 1, 2023, while the y-axis represents the average flow duration in seconds, ranging from 0.3 to 2.1 seconds.\n\nTwo lines are displayed:\n- A light blue line representing streaming-enabled scenarios.\n- A dark blue line representing streaming-disabled scenarios.\n\nThe light blue line (streaming-enabled) consistently stays around 1.5 to 1.8 seconds, with some fluctuations and occasional spikes. The dark blue line (streaming-disabled) starts at around 0.9 seconds and gradually increases, with some fluctuations, reaching approximately 1.4 seconds by the end of the period.\n\nButtons and options for exporting data in JSON and CSV formats are visible at the top, along with other interactive settings. The graph provides a visual comparison of how the average milestone duration varies between streaming-enabled and streaming-disabled scenarios over the specified time frame.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-2-1.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
