The x-axis represents the bins of free OS memory, ranging from 0 to over 15 gigabytes, while the y-axis represents the crash rate.\n\nKey Observations:\n- Each bubble represents a specific bin of free OS memory and its corresponding crash rate.\n- The size of the bubbles indicates the relative frequency or magnitude of crashes within those bins.\n- Larger bubbles are observed on the left side of the chart, suggesting higher crash rates when free OS memory is low.\n- As free OS memory increases, the bubbles become smaller and more sparse, indicating lower crash rates.\n- There is a noticeable concentration of larger bubbles (higher crash rates) in the bins with less than approximately 6 gigabytes of free OS memory.\n- Beyond this point, the crash rate generally decreases, as evidenced by smaller and fewer bubbles.\n\nThe chart effectively shows an inverse relationship between the amount of free OS memory and the crash rate, highlighting that crashes are more frequent when the system has less free memory.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-6-4.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
