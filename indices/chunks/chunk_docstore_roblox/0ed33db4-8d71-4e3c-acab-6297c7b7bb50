Can this regression be root-caused using SliceFinder?\n\nUsing SliceFinder, I was able to find the top contributors and quantify its subfactor compositions\n\nin under 2 minutes. The result aligns with Vijay\u2019s own findings.\n\nWe are currently planning on creating a SliceFinder MLP pipeline to continuously monitor and\n\nroot-cause join time changes on a week-to-week or month-to-month basis.\n\nDAU/MAU spike case\n\nw/ Patrick Fang\n\nThis case helped me test an aggregated-data task with a ratio-type metric. \u25cf The User team saw an increase of global DAU/MAU between Summer 2022 and Summer 2023. Can this increase be root-caused using SliceFinder?\n\nWithin 90 seconds, SliceFinder found contributions from user segments by their platform,\n\ncountry, gender, age_group and the 2nd-degree combinations. Particularly, I found the Android segment\u2019s DAU/MAU contributed the most to the global change. This mirrors the User team\u2019s own observation on their dashboard.\n\nSliceFinder adds valuable insights to User team\u2019s metric reporting by quantifying the\n\ncontribution of each subfactor of each user segment.\n\nCPU usage overload case\n\nw/ Colin Dillard\n\nThis case helped me test an aggregated-data task with a sum-type metric. \u25cf On several occasions, Infra\u2019s Capacity team noticed many datacenters are running close to\n\n\n\ncapacity caps. Can this increase be root-caused using SliceFinder? I ran SliceFinder on two reported incidents, and for both incidents SliceFinder correctly identified the games that had major CPU efficiency degradation or volume increase that contributed to the overload of datacenters.\n\nEngine data quality case\n\nw/ Hongyi Yu", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
