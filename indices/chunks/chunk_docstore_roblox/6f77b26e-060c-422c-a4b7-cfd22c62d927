The y-axis represents \"Run time (seconds)\" and ranges from 0 to 450.\n\nTwo lines are plotted on the graph:\n1. A blue line labeled \"No filtering.\"\n2. An orange line labeled \"With effect size and t-test filtering.\"\n\nThe blue line (No filtering) shows a sharp increase in runtime as the max degree goes from 2 to 3, reaching over 400 seconds at a max degree of 3. The orange line (With effect size and t-test filtering) also increases but at a slower rate compared to the blue line, reaching slightly above 200 seconds at a max degree of 3.\n\nOverall, the graph indicates that using effect size and t-test filtering significantly reduces the runtime compared to no filtering, especially as the max degree increases.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report/figure-5-4.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
