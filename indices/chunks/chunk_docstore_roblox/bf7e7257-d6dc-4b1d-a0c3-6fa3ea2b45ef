It shows two distributions: one for all data slices (in blue) and another for a particular slice of interest (in orange). The distribution is shown for Week 1, as indicated by the title \"Week 1 New\".\n\nIn the histogram:\n\n- The x-axis represents the join time.\n- The y-axis represents the frequency of the join times.\n- The blue bars illustrate the frequency distribution of join times for all slices.\n- The orange bars illustrate the frequency distribution of join times for the slice of interest.\n- A vertical dashed line marks the 90th percentile (P90) join time, which is measured at approximately 324.33.\n\nThis visual helps compare the distribution of join times between the entire dataset and the specific slice of interest for a particular week.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-10-15.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
