In the bubble plot, the size of the bubble corresponds to the size of the slice and the color corresponds to the type of the slice filtering condition. Hover over to see the statistics of the slice (effect size, p value, average metric, etc.)\n\nFigure 5. Visualization of crash rate snapshot RCA result.

SliceFinder takes the target metric baseline from reference data and finds slices in compared data that deviate the farthest from that baseline. Then, we get slices from reference data using the filtering conditions from compared data slices.\n\nFigure 6. Time series task handling workflow.\n\nTime series: quantifying the importance of slices\n\nOnce slices have been found, we want to find the contribution from each slice to the global metric change. Let\u2019s say our task is to find the main driver of the global DAU/MAU change year over year. By finding each slice\u2019s contribution, SliceFinder is essentially solving this problem: if global MAU did not change, how much DAU did this slice add? SliceFinder first calculates the\n\nthree effects that constitute the contribution (you can try out the decomposition using this demo here):\n\n1. Volume effect: volume effect assumes the global DAU/MAU ratio did not change, and the additional DAU purely comes from volume (MAU) change of this slice. The volume effect is positive if the slice\u2019s volume increased.\n\n2. Mix effect: mix effect accounts for the fact that each segment may intrinsically have a", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
