The graph displays two lines representing these categories: a blue line for streaming and a black line for non-streaming.\n\nThe y-axis represents the average flow duration in seconds, ranging from 0 to 2.1 seconds. The x-axis shows the date range. Throughout the period, the blue line (streaming) maintains a relatively stable duration, hovering around 1.5 seconds with occasional peaks. In comparison, the black line (non-streaming) starts below 1 second and rises gradually, showing more variability and reaching closer to the streaming line towards the end of the period.\n\nThere is a label indicating 65 rows of data have been cached, with an execution time of 00:00:00.16 seconds. Controls for exporting the data in JSON or CSV formats are also visible.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report/figure-2-1.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
