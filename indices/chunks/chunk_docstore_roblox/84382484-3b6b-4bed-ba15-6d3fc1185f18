SliceFinder\u2019s contribution decomposition workflow.\" The flowchart illustrates how total contribution is broken down into three main effects: Volume Effect, Mix Effect, and Rate Effect. Each of these main effects is further decomposed into subfactors. \n\n- **Volume Effect** is divided into Subfactor 1 Volume Effect, Subfactor 2 Volume Effect, and Subfactor N Volume Effect.\n- **Mix Effect** is divided into Subfactor 1 Mix Effect, Subfactor 2 Mix Effect, and Subfactor N Mix Effect.\n- **Rate Effect** is divided into Subfactor 1 Rate Effect, Subfactor 2 Rate Effect, and Subfactor N Rate Effect.\n\nThe flowchart visually depicts a hierarchical structure, indicating a methodical approach to breaking down and analyzing contributions through different effects and their respective subfactors.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-10-10.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
