Analyzing every Sunday would be a good starting point.\n\nOther potential use case:\n\nSnapshot:\n\nModel fairness is one of the intended use cases of the original SliceFinder. Model fairness is a critical aspect of machine learning that seeks to ensure that algorithms make decisions that are equitable across all user segments. SliceFinder can be used to find slices/user segments that an ML model predicts particularly poorly on. By surfacing these segments, teams can prioritize interventions, refine their models, and continuously work towards more equitable and fair outcomes for all users.\n\nA/B testing:\n\nSliceFinder\u2019s time series handling can be easily adapted to handle A/B testing cases to identify the biggest drivers for the differences between control and treatment groups. The user can then make more informed decisions on feature rollouts and understand the nuances behind the test results.\n\nComparison with Metric Analyzer\n\nMetric Analyzer is an RCA tool developed by Wei Tang. Similar to SliceFinder, Metric Analyzer can handle time series problems where the target metric has many subfactors. It decomposes the target metric change using Taylor\u2019s Theorem. The biggest differences between Metric Analyzer and SliceFinder are that:\n\n1. Metric Analyzer handles aggregated data, while SliceFinder handles both aggregated and raw\n\ndata\n\n2. Metric Analyzer only looks at the aggregation level provided by the user (the user can write a loop to loop through all desired agg_levels), while SliceFinder automatically looks at all aggregation levels starting from the most coarse agg_level up to the user-specified degree threshold.\n\n3. SliceFinder can handle percentile metrics (no subfactor decomposition) while Metric Analyzer\n\ncannot.\n\nMetric Analyzer vs SliceFinder comparison table:\n\nMetric Analyzer\n\nSliceFinder", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
