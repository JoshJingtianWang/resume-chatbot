This helps further narrow down to the most\n\ncritical aspects of each user/game segment.\n\nTo that end, we developed SliceFinder, an automatic RCA tool. It is important to note that SliceFinder does not establish causal relationships between the \u201croot causes\u201d it identifies and the target metric\n\nchange. Rather, it compiles a list of clues that accelerates the user\u2019s RCA process. Here we refer to SliceFinder as an RCA tool for the sake of simplicity.\n\nSliceFinder\n\nWhat is a slice?\n\nIn SliceFinder, a slice is defined as a conjunction of feature-value pairs (e.g. country: US) where having fewer pairs is considered more interpretable. An interesting (or problematic) slice is a slice that deviates far enough from the global target metric baseline based on effect size and significance test filtering. The slice finding algorithm is based on a 2019 publication from Google.\n\nHow SliceFinder finds slices:\n\nSlice Finder loops through all slices with one degree (one feature-value pair. E.g. country: US), and filters them based on effect size and significance testing. Only the rejected (not met filtering thresholds) feature-value pairs participate in the second round, where feature-value pairs are crossed to form slices with two degrees. This continues until the user-specified number of degrees or desired number of accepted slices has been reached. This algorithm is termed \u201clattice search\u201d due to its lattice-like paths during slicing and crossing. See Table 1 for pseudocode.\n\nSliceFinder detailed algorithm:\n\n1.\n\nInitialization: Set up empty lists for problematic slices (S), candidates (C as a priority queue), and non-problematic slices (N). Set degrees (feature-value pairs) count (L) and initialize alpha wealth (W).\n\n2.
