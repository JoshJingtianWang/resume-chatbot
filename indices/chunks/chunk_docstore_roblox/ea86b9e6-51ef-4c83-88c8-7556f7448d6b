The P90 values are:\n  - Week 1: P90 = 265.20\n  - Week 2: P90 = 415.20\n  - Week 1 New: P90 = 324.33\n\nThe data appears to be normally distributed, with a peak in the middle and tails on both ends, typical of a bell curve. The \"Slice of interest\" subset is a smaller part of the \"All Slices\" and is consistently positioned towards the lower end of the x-axis.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-10-12.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
