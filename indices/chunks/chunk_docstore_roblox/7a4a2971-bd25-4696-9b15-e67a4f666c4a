Visualization of crash rate snapshot RCA result.\" The plot appears to be interactive, as suggested by the caption \"Download and open in the browser to interact with it.\"\n\nIn the scatter plot:\n- The x-axis represents the \"Crash Rate,\" ranging from 0 to 1.1.\n- The y-axis represents the \"Effect Size,\" ranging from -4 to 0.\n- Each data point is a bubble that varies in size and color.\n\nThe colors and their corresponding categories are:\n- Blue: user_specs\n- Red: game_related\n- Green: performance\n- Purple: feature_adoption\n- Orange: user\n- Black: Other\n\nMost of the data points are clustered around a crash rate of 0.2 to 0.4 and an effect size of around -0.5, with various colors indicating different categories. The largest bubbles appear at higher crash rates, especially near a crash rate of 1.0, with black and blue colors indicating categories \"Other\" and \"user_specs,\" respectively.\n\nThe plot provides a visual representation of the relationship between crash rates and their effect sizes across different categories, helping to identify which factors may contribute more significantly to higher crash rates.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report/figure-8-9.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
