The charts use blue bubbles, varying in size to represent the number of crashes within the specified bins.\n\n1. **Top Chart: \"Crash rate by free_os_mem\"**\n   - **X-Axis:** Represents the bins of free operating system memory in gigabytes, ranging from approximately 0 to 25.\n   - **Y-Axis:** Represents the crash rate.\n   - **Observation:** The crash rate appears to be higher when the free operating system memory is lower, with larger bubbles (indicating more crashes) concentrated on the left side of the chart. As the amount of free memory increases, the crash rate decreases, with smaller bubbles and fewer crashes observed towards the right.\n\n2. **Bottom Chart: \"Crash rate by passmark_score\"**\n   - **X-Axis:** Represents the bins of the adjusted PassMark score, which is a measure of overall system performance, ranging from approximately 300 to 10300.\n   - **Y-Axis:** Represents the crash rate.\n   - **Observation:** Similar to the top chart, the crash rate is higher with lower PassMark scores, with larger bubbles on the left side of the chart. As the PassMark score increases, the crash rate decreases, with fewer and smaller bubbles observed towards the right.\n\nOverall, both charts indicate that higher system resources (in terms of free memory and PassMark scores) are associated with lower crash rates.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report/figure-6-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
