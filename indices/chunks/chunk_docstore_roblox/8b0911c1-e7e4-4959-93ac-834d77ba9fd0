I set the dirty entries as the target for SliceFinder and within seconds, provided clues \u25cf which helped the engineers discover the root cause.\n\n\n\nI adapted SliceFinder to become Data Quality Explainer to help troubleshoot data quality issues in the future.\n\nPotential crash rate use case\n\nw/ Igor Viarheichyk There was no SliceFinder implementation with this case. But the conversation I had with Igor (EM of NativeFoundation/App Health) informed how SliceFinder can potentially be useful in root-causing crash rate movement.\n\nWhen root-causing crashing, it is crucial to know if the crashing happening with game\n\ncode or with the app (native layer) (where in the session lifecycle is crashing happening): If crashing with place_id = 0, it means crashing happened before any places were initialized \u2192 problem likely associated with the Native Layer If crashing with session_length < 5 \u2192 crashing on startup \u2192 problem likely associated with Native Layer If crashing with OOM \u2192 not a problem with game code \u2192 problem likely associated with Harmony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElse \u2192 problem associated with game code and game drivers (GPU drivers) \u2192\n\nlikely Engine problem\n\nWhy is DSA seeing that Android crashes more?\n\nIt may not be crashing more. Many Android devices allow force close (swiping up), which may be considered an \u201cungraceful shutdown\u201d and is logged in the next session as an inferred crash. In iOS, that action is not considered ungraceful. As a result, Android devices show \u201cinferred crashing\u201d more. In reality, iOS devices have an actual crash rate of around 2% while Android have 1% (grafana, EngineTelemetry, clientcrash). \u25cf How should time-series RCA for device crashing be implemented?", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
