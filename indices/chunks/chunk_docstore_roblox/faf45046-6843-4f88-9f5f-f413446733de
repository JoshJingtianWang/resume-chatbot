In SliceFinder, hypotheses arrive in a sequence and the number of hypotheses is not fixed a priori. This makes online methods like alpha-investing more suitable. In addition, with alpha investing, the user can prioritize certain tests over others by allocating more of the alpha wealth to those tests (e.g. by sorting each batch of slices by size). This is beneficial in cases where certain hypotheses are deemed more important or interesting than others.\n\nDecisionTree:\n\nThe original SliceFinder publication included a DecisionTree algorithm as an alternative to lattice search.\n\nFrom the whole dataset (root slice), the decision tree is navigated in a breadth-first manner to pinpoint the top-k problematic slices. Here, each level of the tree is expanded based on minimizing impurity, and the resulting slices are ranked and filtered based on their statistical significance and effect size.\n\nThe beauty of this method lies in its natural interpretability, as the tree's leaves represent distinct data slices. However, its partitioning nature means overlapping problematic slices might be overlooked. For example, since Slice (country: US) and Slice (os: Android) overlap, they will not both be identified by DecisionTree even if they are both potentially interesting.\n\nFor the rest of the project, I proceeded with the lattice search algorithm because it returns more information.\n\nInitial Results and the Problem:\n\nInitially I used SliceFinder directly on Engine\u2019s session_tracking table (Fct_client_session_tracking (ds = 2023-06-24)) to root-cause device crashing. This table reports each play session\u2019s device information and the outcome of each session (success or inferred crashing).", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
