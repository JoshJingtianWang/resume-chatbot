The histogram uses two different colors to differentiate between two categories: \"All Slices\" (in blue) and a \"Slice of interest\" (in orange). The blue histogram represents the distribution of all join times, while the orange histogram shows the distribution of the join times for a specific subset of interest within the data.\n\nA vertical dashed blue line is positioned at the join time of approximately 265.20, which is labeled as \"P90 = 265.20.\" This indicates that 90% of the join times fall below this value. The histogram peaks around the middle of the x-axis and tapers off towards both ends, forming a roughly bell-shaped distribution. The frequency for \"All Slices\" reaches as high as 800, while the \"Slice of interest\" has a lower peak frequency.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-10-13.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
