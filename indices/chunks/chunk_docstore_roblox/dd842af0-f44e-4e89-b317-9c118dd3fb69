Beyond that, the runtime remains consistently low, suggesting this method benefits significantly from parallel processing, especially with just a few workers.\n\nThe legend in the graph clarifies the color coding for the two methods. Overall, the graph illustrates that the \"Parallel by one batch per process\" method is much more efficient in terms of runtime compared to the \"Parallel by one slice per process\" method as the number of workers increases.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-7-6.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
