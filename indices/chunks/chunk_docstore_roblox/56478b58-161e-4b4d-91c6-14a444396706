Visualization of crash rate snapshot RCA result.\" The scatter plot visualizes data points representing various factors affecting crash rates, with an interactive feature accessible through a browser download.\n\nKey elements of the plot include:\n- **Axes**: The x-axis represents the \"Crash Rate,\" ranging from 0 to slightly above 1. The y-axis represents the \"Effect Size,\" ranging from -4 to 0.\n- **Data Points**: Each point on the scatter plot is color-coded and categorized into different factors:\n  - Blue: user_specs\n  - Red: game_related\n  - Green: performance\n  - Purple: feature_adoption\n  - Orange: user\n  - Black: Other\n- **Size of Data Points**: The size of the circles varies, indicating the magnitude or significance of the particular data point within its category.\n- **Distribution**: Many points are clustered towards the lower crash rates (0.0-0.4) and lower effect sizes (-1 to 0). There are some outliers with higher crash rates (up to 1.1) and lower effect sizes (down to -4).\n\nThe interactive feature likely allows users to explore the data points in more detail, providing insights into the relationship between crash rates and various contributing factors.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-8-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
