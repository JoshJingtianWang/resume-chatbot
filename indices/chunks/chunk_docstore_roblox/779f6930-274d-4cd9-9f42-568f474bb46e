The x-axis represents the join time, ranging from 0 to 500, while the y-axis represents the frequency of occurrences, ranging from 0 to 800.\n\nThe histogram has two sets of data:\n1. **All Slices**: Represented by blue bars, showing the overall distribution of join times.\n2. **Slice of interest**: Represented by brown bars, showing a subset of the data within the overall distribution.\n\nA vertical dashed blue line at approximately 415.20 marks the P90 value (90th percentile), indicating that 90% of the join times fall below this value. The histogram exhibits a roughly symmetric, bell-shaped distribution, with the highest frequency of join times occurring around the center of the range.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-10-14.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
