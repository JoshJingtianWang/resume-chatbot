The causal tree could be adapted into an alternative to SliceFinder for time series tasks for a slightly different objective. While SliceFinder finds slices that contributed the most to the global change, the causal tree finds slices that are most affected by the treatment (both positively and negatively). In other words, while SliceFinder\u2019s end goal is to understand/improve the global metric, the causal tree\u2019s end goal is to understand the differential impacts of an intervention across user segments. This makes the causal a more appropriate tool for diagnosing A/B testing for feature impact.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
