The x-axis represents the number of workers, ranging from 0 to 15, while the y-axis represents the time taken in seconds, ranging from 0 to 80.\n\nThere are two lines on the graph:\n1. A blue line labeled \"Parallel by one slice per process\" which shows that the time taken hovers around 70-75 seconds regardless of the number of workers.\n2. An orange line labeled \"Parallel by one batch per process\" which starts at around 10 seconds with one worker, sharply drops to about 5 seconds with two workers, and then remains relatively constant around 5 seconds as the number of workers increases.\n\nThe graph indicates that the \"Parallel by one batch per process\" method is significantly faster than the \"Parallel by one slice per process\" method, especially as the number of workers increases.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report/figure-7-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
