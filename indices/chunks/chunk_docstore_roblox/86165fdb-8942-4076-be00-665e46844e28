The graph features two lines, one likely representing streaming-enabled scenarios (in light blue) and the other representing streaming-disabled scenarios (in dark blue).\n\n- The vertical axis (y-axis) represents the average flow duration in seconds, ranging from 0 to 2.1 seconds.\n- The horizontal axis (x-axis) represents the date over the specified period.\n- The light blue line (streaming-enabled) starts around 1.5 seconds, shows some fluctuations, peaking slightly above 1.8 seconds in early May, and then stabilizes around 1.6 seconds towards the end of the period.\n- The dark blue line (streaming-disabled) starts below 1 second, shows a gradual increase, and aligns closer to the streaming-enabled line around mid-May, eventually stabilizing around 1.4 seconds towards the end of the period.\n\nOverall, the graph indicates that the streaming-enabled scenario generally has a higher average milestone duration compared to the streaming-disabled scenario, which shows an increasing trend over the monitored period.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report/figure-2-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
