The graph features two lines:\n\n1. A blue line labeled \"No filtering.\"\n2. An orange line labeled \"With effect size and t test filtering.\"\n\nThe x-axis represents the max degree, ranging from 1 to 3. The y-axis represents the run time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 450.\n\nObservations:\n- Both lines start at a similar point around 0 seconds for a max degree of 1.\n- As the max degree increases, the run time increases for both conditions.\n- The blue line (No filtering) shows a significantly higher increase in run time compared to the orange line (With effect size and t test filtering).\n- At a max degree of 3, the run time for the blue line reaches just above 400 seconds, whereas the run time for the orange line is just under 200 seconds.\n\nThis suggests that using effect size and t-test filtering reduces the run time compared to no filtering, especially as the max degree increases.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-4-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
