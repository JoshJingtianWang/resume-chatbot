The x-axis, labeled \"Bins (passmark_score_adj_v1),\" seems to represent different ranges or bins of adjusted PassMark scores, which measure the performance of computer systems or components. The y-axis represents the crash rate.\n\nEach bubble on the chart represents a data point, with the position determined by the PassMark score bin and the corresponding crash rate. The size of the bubbles appears to vary, indicating the frequency or significance of the data points.\n\nThe overall trend shows that higher PassMark scores are associated with lower crash rates, suggesting that better-performing systems are generally more stable. The bubbles are larger and more concentrated towards the left side of the graph, indicating higher crash rates for systems with lower PassMark scores. As the PassMark scores increase (moving to the right), the crash rates generally decrease, and the bubbles become smaller and more scattered.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report/figure-6-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
