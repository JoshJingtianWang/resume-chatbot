SliceFinder\u2019s contribution decomposition workflow.\n\nPercentile metric handling:\n\nSliceFinder can find the contribution of each slice to the change of percentile metrics. Consider a case where the 90 percentile join time (P90 join time) regressed from 265.20 ms to 415.20 ms. For each slice, SliceFinder considers a counterfactual scenario where only our target slice is driving the global change, and all other slices did not change (Figure 8). SliceFinder then uses the new hypothetical P90 metric to find the slice\u2019s contribution: \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 = (\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58 1 \ud835\udc4390 \u2212 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58 1 \ud835\udc4390) / \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58 2 \ud835\udc4390\n\nFigure 8. Logic behind SliceFinder\u2019s percentile metric handling. In all three panels, blue is the distribution of the target metric (join time) of all data, and orange is the distribution of our slice of interest\u2019s data. The left panel is Week 1, the middle panel is Week 2, and the right panel is Week 1\u2019s join time after replacing our slice of interest with its Week 2 counterpart.\n\nFor percentile metrics, SliceFinder is no longer able to conduct effect size and significance testing to filter for interesting slices. Instead, it does an exhaustive grid search to find all slices. As a result, we recommend setting the degree parameter to be lower than 3 when dealing with percentile metrics.\n\nAggregated data handling:", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
