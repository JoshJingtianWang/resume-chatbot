It begins with the question, \"Is it a time series task (A vs B)?\" and branches out based on answers to further questions. These questions determine whether the data involves percentile metrics, sum metrics, and whether the data is aggregated.\n\nKey decision points and outcomes include:\n- If it is a time series task and involves percentile metrics with aggregated data, it might lead to either \"See Result #2\" or a message that \"Cannot find contribution.\"\n- If the time series involves sum metrics and aggregated data, depending on further answers, it can lead to \"See Result #1\" or configurations like \"See config #1,\" \"See config #2,\" or \"See config #3.\"\n- If it is not a time series task, the flowchart asks if there are percentile metrics or aggregated data. If so, it might lead to \"Cannot process\" or \"See Config #5.\"\n- If it is neither time series nor aggregated data, it directs to \"See Result #3.\"\n\nEach path in the flowchart guides the user through a series of checks to find the appropriate configuration or result based on the data and metrics involved.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-12-18.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
