In Engine, data tables can be complex: there is often high cardinality and dimensionality in datasets and we sometimes lack the domain knowledge to understand how each dimension affects the target metric. As a result, it took the team 6 days from ticket creation to identifying the root cause. The delay in identifying the root cause may lead to further degradation of user experience and potential revenue loss.\n\nFigure 1. Global average experience_launch_end milestone duration from April to May. Light blue line is non-streaming enabled games, dark blue line is streaming-enabled games.\n\nTherefore, we need a high-throughput root-cause analysis (RCA) tool that:\n\n1. Handles highly complex datasets without requiring domain knowledge or ad-hoc dashboarding. 2. Ranks possible root causes by their contribution to global change. This quantifies the effect of each root cause and helps prioritize most critical user/game segments to address.\n\n3. Decomposes the contributions into subfactors. This helps further narrow down to the most", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
