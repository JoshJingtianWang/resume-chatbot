The y-axis represents the crash rate, while the x-axis denotes the bins of passmark scores, which measure the performance of the devices (higher scores indicate more powerful devices). Each bubble in the plot represents a data point, where the size of the bubble corresponds to the size of the slice or data segment.\n\nFrom the plot, it is evident that devices with lower passmark scores tend to have higher crash rates, as shown by the larger bubbles clustered towards the lower end of the passmark score range. Conversely, as the passmark scores increase, the crash rates generally decrease, indicated by the smaller and more scattered bubbles towards the higher end of the passmark score range. This suggests a negative correlation between device performance and crash rates, where more powerful devices (with higher passmark scores) experience fewer crashes.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-6-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
