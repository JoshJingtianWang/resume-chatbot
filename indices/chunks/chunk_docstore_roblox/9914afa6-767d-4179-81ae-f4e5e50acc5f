The x-axis represents bins of free OS memory, ranging from around 0 to 15.5 gigabytes. The y-axis represents the crash rate, which ranges from 0.000 to 0.200.\n\nIn the chart, each bubble represents a data point, with its size indicating the frequency or significance of that data point. The larger bubbles are concentrated towards the lower end of the free memory spectrum, suggesting a higher crash rate when available memory is low. As the available memory increases, the bubbles become smaller and more sparse, indicating a lower crash rate with more available memory.\n\nThe labels on the x-axis are slightly angled for readability and denote the bins of free OS memory in gigabytes. Overall, the chart illustrates a general trend where crash rates decrease as more free memory is available in the operating system.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Josh Wang Internship at Roblox Report/figure-6-6.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
