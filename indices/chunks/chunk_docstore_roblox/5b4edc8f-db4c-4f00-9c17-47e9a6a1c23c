The data points in both plots are represented by blue circles, with the size of the circles indicating the density or frequency of data points within that bin.\n\n1. **Top Plot**:\n   - **Title**: \"Crash rate by free_os_mem\"\n   - **X-Axis**: \"Bins (free_os_mem in gigabytes)\" - This axis represents different ranges of free operating system memory, measured in gigabytes.\n   - **Y-Axis**: \"Crash rate\" - This axis represents the crash rate, likely as a proportion.\n   - **Description**: The plot shows a trend where higher amounts of free OS memory generally correspond to lower crash rates. The largest circles, indicating higher data density, are concentrated towards the lower end of free OS memory, which also shows higher crash rates. As free OS memory increases, the crash rate decreases and the circles become smaller and more spread out.\n\n2. **Bottom Plot**:\n   - **Title**: \"Crash rate by passmark_score\"\n   - **X-Axis**: \"Bins (passmark_score_adj_v1)\" - This axis represents different ranges of PassMark scores, which are performance benchmarking scores for computer systems.\n   - **Y-Axis**: \"Crash rate\" - This axis represents the crash rate, likely as a proportion.\n   - **Description**: The plot shows a trend where higher PassMark scores generally correspond to lower crash rates. The largest circles, indicating higher data density, are concentrated towards the lower end of PassMark scores, where crash rates are higher. As the PassMark scores increase, the crash rates decrease and the circles become smaller and more spread out.\n\nOverall, both plots suggest that higher system performance (indicated by more free OS memory and higher PassMark scores) is associated with lower crash rates.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-6-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
