The workflow involves two sets of data labeled as \"Week 1 Data\" and \"Week 2 Data.\" \n\n1. **Week 1 Data**: \n   - The process begins with \"Week 1 Data,\" which is used to generate \"Week 1 Slices\" through the application of \"Filtering conditions.\"\n  \n2. **Week 2 Data**: \n   - Concurrently, \"Week 2 Data\" is processed by a component labeled \"SliceFinder\" to produce \"Week 2 Slices.\"\n   \n3. **Baseline Comparison**: \n   - A baseline is established between \"Week 1 Data\" and \"Week 2 Data,\" likely to compare and analyze the changes or consistencies between the two weeks.\n   \n4. **Contribution Analysis**: \n   - The slices from both weeks, specifically \"Week 1 Slices\" and \"Week 2 Slices,\" are then used to \"Find contribution,\" which might involve identifying the differences and contributions of various data points or segments over the two weeks.\n\nThis workflow indicates a structured approach to compare and analyze time-series data across different time periods by segmenting the data into slices and applying specific filtering conditions.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/Roblox/Project 1_ SliceFinder Final Writeup/figure-8-9.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
