Positive if number of users in that slice increased. (sum-type metrics)\n\nMix effect: like volume effect, but considers the difference of revenue per user between the slice and the global. (ratio/average-type metrics)\n\nRate effect: effect from revenue per user. Positive if revenue per user increased.\n\nDemo\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\nFurther decomposition\n\nEach of the 3 main effects can be further decomposed.\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\nUser Interface\n\nGitHub\n\nUser follows setup guide on GitHub to set up the config and prepare data.\n\nRun SliceFinder in one line:\n\nresult_df = run_delta(config, reference_df, compared_df)\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\nAgenda\n\nIntern Project 1: SliceFinder\n\nOverview (7/26/23 BYOL slides)\n\nSubfactor decomposition (update)\n\nUser interface\n\nSuccessful use cases\n\nIntern Project 2: HumanoidStateChange Dashboard\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\nSuccessful Use Cases\n\nJoin time regression case\n\nw/ Vijay Balaji\n\nRaw data, average-type metric\n\nDatacenter near CPU capacity case\n\nw/ Colin Dillard\n\nAggregated data, sum-type metric\n\nSummer DAU/MAU spike case\n\nw/ Patrick Fang\n\nAggregated data, ratio-type metric\n\nEngine team data quality case\n\nw/ Hongyi Yu\n\nSnapshot\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\nJoin Time Regression Case\n\nMLP Pipeline\n\nSliceFinder pinpoints precise areas for optimization\n\nGame join time increased from 1100ms to 1500ms from April to June.\n\n72%\n\nRate effect\n\n82%\n\nVolume + mix effect\n\n10%\n\nRate effect\n\n15%\n\n16%\n\nVolume + mix effect\n\n1%\n\nCase write-up\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\n\u2039#\u203a\n\nDatacenter CPU Usage Case\n\nSliceFinder decomposition provides a granular view of the root cause\n\nOn several occasions, we noticed datacenters are running close to capacity.\n\nCPU efficiency was already low", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/Roblox/Josh Wang Final Presentation DSA.pptx"}, "type": "Document"}}
