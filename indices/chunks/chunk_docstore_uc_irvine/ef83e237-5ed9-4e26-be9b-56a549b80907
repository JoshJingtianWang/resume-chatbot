It starts with the \"Proteome\" which consists of 13,824 proteins, depicted using colorful shapes. This proteome is further divided into several categories:\n\n1. **RBPome**: Contains 2,508 proteins that are associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBP).\n2. **PTMome**: Comprises 2,381 proteins associated with post-translational modifications (PTM).\n3. **PTM Regulation**: Encompasses 2,312 proteins involved in regulating PTMs, shown with interactions involving a \"Depositor\" (green square) and a \"Remover\" (orange hexagon).\n4. **PTM Mutations**: Includes 9,446 specific mutations affecting PTMs.\n5. **Mutation Proximity**: Contains 100,002 mutations located in proximity to the proteins shown.\n\nThe diagram uses directional arrows to indicate relationships and interactions between these subsets, emphasizing the complexity and interconnections within the proteome and its regulatory mechanisms.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-30-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
