In the\n\ndeveloping retina, the RB pathway is critical in development and tumorigenesis. Genetic\n\nablation of RB is characterized by alterations in ganglion cell, bipolar, and rod\n\nphotoreceptor terminal differentiation that results in cell death of these retinal cells and\n\n98\n\ndisruption of horizontal cell synaptogenesis2,3. Further, almost all retinoblastomas\n\nhave RB1 gene inactivation4,5. While genetic alterations in the RB1 gene are required for\n\ntumor initiation, retinoblastoma tumors have stable genomes, with tumor progression\n\noccurring through epigenetic dysregulation of several cancer pathways6.\n\nHELLS (helicase, lymphoid specific; also known as LSH, ICF4, PASG, and SMARCA6),\n\na gene transcriptionally controlled by the RB/E2F pathway7\u20139 , encodes a chromatin\n\nremodeling protein thought to be responsible for the epigenetic changes seen in\n\nretinoblastoma and required for tumor survival10. HELLS is a SWI/SNF-related matrix-\n\nassociated regulator of chromatin that contributes to global genome methylation11. HELLS\n\nremodels chromatin to render DNA accessible to DNA methyltransferase enzymes Dnmt3a\n\nor Dnmt3b, supporting de novo DNA methylation and stable gene silencing during cellular\n\ndifferentiation12,13. Binding of HELLS to DNMT1, HDAC1, and HDAC2 has also been\n\nreported14. HELLS plays an important role in normal development as HELLS knockout mice\n\ndisplay perinatal lethality15. Furthermore, HELLS mutant mice exhibit signs of growth\n\nretardation, premature aging, and impaired neural stem/progenitor cells self-renewal and\n\nmaintenance during development 16,17. Thus, consideration of HELLS as a therapeutic target\n\nin the treatment of cancers requires careful consideration of the potential toxicities that\n\ncould arise in tissues exposed to treatment.\n\nThe vertebrate neural retina is organized with remarkable precision into laminar", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
