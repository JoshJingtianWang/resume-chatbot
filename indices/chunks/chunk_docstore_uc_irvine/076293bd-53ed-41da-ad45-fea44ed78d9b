A clear separation of an excellent\n\nSV40-TATA box from the rest was illustrated: the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SV40-TATA\n\npromoter is 1000 fold and twice as high as the SNR of minYB-TATA and TK-TATA (Figure 4-\n\n3d, Table S1). Collectively, we have obtained a better design of the Tet-ON inducible O-TetR-\n\nA system.\n\nAs previously demonstrated, the 61nt version of Long-YB-TATA promoter, facilitating\n\nhigher mCherry expression without elevating observable leakiness than minYB-TATA,\n\n(Figure 4-S1) led us to revisit this promoter design. In this experiment, we replaced YB-\n\nTATA box with the best non-canonical SV40-TATA box sequence (Figure 4-3e) resulting\n\nLong-SV40-TATA. HEK293 was transfected with either Long-SV40-TATA or Long-YB-TATA\n\nvector and subjected to imaging and flow cytometry analyses.\n\nImaging results showed that mCherry signal driven by Long-YB-TATA promoter was\n\nhigher than the signal from Long-SV40-TATA when induced with Dox (0.5\u00b5g/mL). In order\n\nto detect basal expression driven by the two promoters, images were taken under long (2\n\nseconds) exposure and revealed low but detectable red fluorescence signal from the un-\n\ninduced Long-YB-TATA transfected cells. Under the same experimental conditions, un-\n\ninduced Long-SV40-TATA transfected cells showed little or below detectable level of\n\nmCherry (Figure 4-3f). HEK293 cells transfected with Long-SV40-TATA, SV40-TATA (short),\n\nLong-YB-TATA or minYB-TATA were analyzed via flow cytometry 48h post induction.\n\n77\n\nConsistent with imaging data, flow results showed higher SNRs for both SV40-TATA versions\n\nthan those of the two YB-TATA vectors. These results indicate that the noise level from un-\n\ninduced cells transfected with either versions of YB-TATA is much higher than that of SV40-", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
