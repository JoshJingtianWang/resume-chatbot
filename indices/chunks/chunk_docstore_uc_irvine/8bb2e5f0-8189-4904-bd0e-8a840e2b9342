The rows represent different doxycycline (Dox) concentrations (ranging from 0 to 1500 ng/mL), while the columns represent different experimental conditions: Empty vector, Untransfected, Long-YB-TATA, and Long-SV40-TATA. In each scatter plot, the x-axis represents mCherry fluorescence intensity, and the y-axis represents cell counts. The data points are colored, with dense regions appearing in green or yellow and less dense areas in blue.\n\n**Part (b):** This section contains a line graph plotting mCherry Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) against varying Dox concentrations (ng/mL) on a logarithmic scale. The graph shows four lines representing different experimental conditions: \n- Long-YB-TATA (red line)\n- Long-SV40-TATA (blue line)\n- Empty plasmid (green line)\n- Untransfected (yellow line).\n\nThe red and blue lines (Long-YB-TATA and Long-SV40-TATA) show a significant increase in mCherry MFI with increasing Dox concentration, whereas the green and yellow lines (Empty plasmid and Untransfected) remain relatively flat, indicating low or no response to Dox.\n\nThe overall summary indicates a study on the Dox-dependent expression of mCherry in different experimental setups, highlighting the effectiveness of Long-YB-TATA and Long-SV40-TATA constructs in driving mCherry expression compared to empty plasmid and untransfected controls.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-92-17.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
