Libraries were amplified and purified according to the NuGen protocol and quality\n\nwas assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA high-sensitivity chip.\n\nRNA-sequencing and bioinformatics\n\nSequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2500. Sequence data were trimmed\n\nusing Trimmomatic prior to mapping to the Drosophila melanogaster cDNA transcriptome\n\n(BDGP6) using kallisto. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq225. The\n\nEUd-RNA reference subset was obtained using the shuf command in UNIX to randomly\n\nselect 2.7 million reads from the EUd-RNA BAM files. Gene ontology analysis was\n\nperformed using DAVID functional annotation clustering26, with the pre-loaded Drosophila\n\nmelanogaster gene set as background, high classification stringency and default settings for\n\nall other parameters. Unnamed genes (those identified only by CG number) were excluded\n\n150\n\nfrom GO analysis. Only categories with an enrichment of \u2265 2.0 and Bonferonni-corrected p-\n\nvalues of < 0.01 were considered significant.\n\nImaging and quantification of dendrite morphology\n\nDendrite morphology was analyzed in wandering larval stages. Larval fillet\n\npreparations were fixed using formaldehyde and stained with rat anti-mCD8\n\n(ThermoFisher) at 1:100 followed by Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rat secondary antibody\n\n(ThermoFisher) at 1:200. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal\n\nmicroscope. The number of branch termini and total dendrite length were quantified in Z-\n\nseries projections. Branch terminal counting and dendrite tracing was performed using\n\nAdobe Photoshop and dendrite length (pixels) were quantified using Zeiss Zen Blue\n\nsoftware. Dendritic field (% coverage) values were calculated by dividing the number of\n\npixels in the dendrite trace by the total number of pixels in the area analyzed (the fixed-size", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
