Our own studies, including this one, indicate that HELLS might be an\n\nattractive target for retinoblastoma therapeutics10. However, since HELLS is critical for the\n\nsurvival of mice and is required for normal tissue development, including the brain17,\n\nunderstanding the function of HELLS during retinal development is relevant if ocular\n\ndelivery of HELLS inhibitors were to be considered as a therapeutic option for this retinal\n\nmalignancy. Fortunately, unlike a previous report showing that HELLS mutant mice exhibit\n\nimpaired neural progenitor cells self-renewal and maintenance during development17, we\n\nshow in this study that Hells depletion does not affect RPC division, cell-fate specification,\n\nnor retinal function. Despite the seemingly dispensable role of Hells in retinal development,\n\nwe found that persistent expression of Hells in Rb1/p107-null retinal cells is critical for\n\nectopic proliferation and retinoblastoma tumor progression.\n\nHells is expressed during retinal cell-fate specification stages, but is nonessential for\n\nnormal retinal development\n\nEpigenetic regulation plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of cell identity as\n\nwell as the stepwise control towards cellular differentiation. Here, we studied the role of\n\nchromatin remodeler HELLS during retinal development. We found that Hells mRNA is\n\nexpressed in early stages of retinal development and declines around postnatal day 6. We\n\nconfirmed that this reduction in gene expression translated into decreased protein\n\nexpression. These patterns of expression suggest that HELLS is involved in the\n\ndevelopment and cell differentiation of the retina, but is not necessary for maintenance of\n\nthe retina once the major cell types have developed.\n\nWe also assessed whether HELLS is critical for normal retinal development using a\n\nconditional knockout mouse model driven by Chx10-Cre recombinase. We found that Hells-\n\n117", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
