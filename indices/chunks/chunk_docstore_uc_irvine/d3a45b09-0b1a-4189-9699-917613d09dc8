In the absence of tetracycline or its derivative such as\n\ndoxycycline (Dox), tTA from Tet-OFF system will dimerize and bind to TetO and mediate\n\ntranscription, whereas rtTA from Tet-ON system remains unbound to TetO and results no\n\n67\n\nexpression. Upon introduction of Dox, tTA binds to Dox, changes conformation, releases from\n\nTetO and stops mediating transcription, whereas rtTA binds to Dox, changes conformation\n\nand is able to bind to TetO and mediates transcription. However, significant reduction of Dox\n\nsensitivity of rtTA in comparison to tTA was reported12 and triggered immense effort to\n\nimprove the system.\n\nEfforts in optimization of Tet-ON system include systematic modification of pTet\n\npromoter13,14, extensive mutagenesis of tTA to isolate an improved function rtTA such as\n\nrtTA3 which harbors six mutations and a tandem of 12 amino acid sequence of VP16\n\nactivation domain instead the classic 127 aa, resulting 25-fold more sensitive to Dox15,16.\n\nAdditional efforts focusing on using additional regulators such as a chicken b-globin\n\ninsulator element to restrict viral enhancer effect on the inducible promoter in a 1-unit tet-\n\ninducible transgene expression AAV construct17 was also reported. Development of\n\nadditional Tet-inducible repressor such as fusion protein of TetR-KRAB domain of Kox118 or\n\nTetR-HDAC419 to be used in combination with rtTA gave greater control in Tet-ON inducible\n\nsystem. However, fusion protein of TetR-eukaryotic repressors potentially posed\n\nunintended complications due to interaction of eukaryotic repressors with other host\n\nelements that might confound overall experimental results or side effects in therapy.\n\nThe inherent leakiness of the Tet-On system20 poses a challenge for researchers in\n\nneed for a truly stringent gene regulation system.
