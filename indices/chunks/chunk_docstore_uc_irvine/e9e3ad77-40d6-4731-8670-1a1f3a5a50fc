As\n\nmentioned, Chx10-Cre is expressed stochastically, therefore complete abrogation of protein\n\nexpression was not expected when using whole retinae.\n\n103\n\nFigure 5-2. Hells is nonessential for normal retinal development. A. Schematic diagram\n\nof flippase (Flp) removal of the neo-cassette and conditional excision of the floxed HELLS\n\nallele. B. Western blot analysis of HELLS expression in Hells cKO (Chx10-Cre Hellslox/lox) and\n\nlittermate control (Hellslox/lox) shows effective reduction of HELLS protein upon Cre\n\nrecombination of floxed HELLS alleles. Actin was used as a loading control. Band intensities\n\nwere quantified by densitometry and normalized to littermate control. C. RT-qPCR analysis\n\nof retinal cell marker genes. The genes of the seven major retina cell types are\n\nproportionately expressed in EGFP+\u2009cells from Hells cKO mice compared with cells from\n\nCre-negative littermate controls. All data are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD normalized to control littermates\n\n(n\u2009=\u20095). D. Representative images of P21 retina cross-sections from Hells cKO Z/EG and\n\nlittermate control mice immunostained with chx10 (bipolar), pkc-alpha (bipolar), and\n\nrecoverin (photoreceptors) antibodies (red). Retinae were double immunostained with\n\nanti-EGFP to capture areas of Chx10-Cre-mediated EGFP expression. Nuclei were\n\ncounterstained with DAPI (blue).
