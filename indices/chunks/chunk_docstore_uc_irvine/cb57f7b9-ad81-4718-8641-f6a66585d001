The image is divided into multiple panels, each displaying specific data and results from the study.\n\n**Panel A** - Shows a principal component analysis (PCA) plot where the variance between different sample groups is depicted. The groups are labeled as Rb1/p107 and Rb1/p107/Hells. The first principal component (PC1) accounts for 75% of the variance, while the second principal component (PC2) accounts for 12%.\n\n**Panel B** - Displays a bar graph of upregulated genes, with the biological processes associated with these genes highlighted. Notably, the genes are involved in sensory perception of light stimulus, visual perception, phototransduction, and related pathways.\n\n**Panel C** - Shows a bar graph of downregulated genes, with processes such as the G1/S transition of the mitotic cell cycle, DNA replication, cell cycle G1/S phase transition, and other related cellular processes highlighted.\n\n**Panel D** - Presents heatmaps showing the distribution of genes in control, Rb1/p107, and Rb1/p107/Hells retinae relative to the transcription start site (TSS). The heat intensity indicates the mean reads and the activity around the TSS.\n\n**Panel E** - Details a list of genes associated with the G1/S transition of the mitotic cell cycle, highlighting their relative expression levels with a color code representing log2 fold change.\n\n**Panel F** - Contains bar plots showing the relative mRNA levels of specific genes (E2f1, Cdc6, Mcm4, Pcna, Ccnb1, MKI67) comparing Rb1/p107 and Rb1/p107/Hells samples. Statistical significance is indicated with asterisks.\n\n**Panel G** - Displays images of retinal sections stained for EdU (indicating proliferating cells), GFP, DAPI (a nuclear stain), and a merged image. These are shown for both Rb1/p107 and Rb1/p107/Hells conditions.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-126-24.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
