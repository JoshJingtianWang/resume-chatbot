Cancer\n\nsamples were discerned from normal samples based on the TCGA barcodes. Cancer\n\n60\n\nsamples harboring the SF3B1 K700E mutation were identified using the TCGA mutational\n\ndata queried in our previous study6.\n\nThe requirements for an alternative splicing event to be considered were as follows:\n\nThe event must have at least 20 non-null PSI values in normal samples.\n\nThe mean PSI values of the event must be >= 0.979 (mean of ORAI2 in normal\n\nsamples) or <= 0.021 (1 - mean of ORAI2 in normal samples).\n\nThe difference between the cancer PSI and normal PSI must be statistically\n\nsignificant (adjusted p< 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, adjusted to multiple\n\ntesting correction)\n\nThe analysis was done in Bash and Python. Visualization was done with the matplotlib\n\nPython module.\n\n3.7 Supplemental Data\n\nFigure 3-S1.
