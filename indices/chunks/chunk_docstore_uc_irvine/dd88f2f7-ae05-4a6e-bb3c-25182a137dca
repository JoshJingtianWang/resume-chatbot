Our RNA-seq analysis detected\n\nsignificant downregulation in all these cell cycle genes. Four of them, E2f1, Cdc6, Mcm4,\n\nand Pcna, are part of the G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle cluster, our most significantly\n\nenriched GO term for downregulated genes (Figure 5-5E). Using RT-qPCR, we were able to\n\nindependently validate downregulation of these genes in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO compared\n\nwith Rb1/p107 DKO P21 retinae (Figure 5-5F).\n\nTo evaluate if the transcriptional downregulation of cell cycle genes\n\nin Rb1/p107/Hells TKO retinae results in limited proliferation, we examined P21 retinae\n\ncross-sections using immunohistochemistry (Figure 5-5G; Supplementary Figure 6) and\n\nimmunocytochemistry of dissociated retinae (Figure 5-5H) from mice injected with EdU 2\u2009h\n\nprior to collection. We observed a clear decrease in the number of EdU-positive cells found\n\nalong the retinae sections in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO P21 retinae compared\n\nwith Rb1/p107 DKO (Figure 5-5G; Supplementary Figure 6). We quantified the extent of the\n\ndecrease in proliferating cells using dissociated retinae and found that the percentage of\n\nEdU-positive cells was significantly lower in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO (0.076\u2009\u00b1\u20090.131%)\n\ncompared with Rb1/p107 DKO (1.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35%; p\u2009=\u20090.0064) retinae (Figure 5-5H). Together,\n\nthese data suggest that HELLS overexpression (or persistent expression) may contribute to\n\nthe maintenance of a de-differentiated and proliferative state in Rb1/p107-null retinae that\n\nbenavente progression may result in retinoblastoma formation.\n\n5.5 Discussion\n\nIn recent years, the chromatin remodeling protein HELLS has been increasingly\n\nconsidered as a therapeutic target in several cancers, including gliomas and\n\n116\n\ncarcinomas26,28,29. Our own studies, including this one, indicate that HELLS might be an\n\nattractive target for retinoblastoma therapeutics10.
