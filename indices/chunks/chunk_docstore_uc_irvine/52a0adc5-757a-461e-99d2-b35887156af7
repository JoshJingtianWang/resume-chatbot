In addition to the EC-tagged data, we performed GO\n\nanalysis on DE results comparing mock-RNA to the complete or subset ref-RNA.\n\nImportantly, the mock-tagged DE data did not result in any significant GO category\n\nenrichment.\n\nFigure 6-3.

In\n\naddition to the genes listed in Figure 6-2, this dataset contains many previously described\n\nmd neuron genes (according to Flybase annotations and associated references), including\n\n142\n\ntranscription regulators (ab, ttk, stan, cnc, jim, kay, gro), RNA-binding\n\nfactors (bel, Caper, Fmrp, sqd, stau, rump), ion channels (Piezo, SK), signal receptors and\n\ntransducers (EcR, Egfr, Rac1, spin, puc), and cytoskeletal factors (spas, shot). We also\n\nidentified multiple transcripts encoding general regulators of neurotransmission,\n\nincluding Frq1, brp, Csp, and Rim. While differences in experimental design and target cell\n\npopulations limit the validity of broad comparisons between our data and prior\n\ntranscriptome studies, we selected two gene lists from prior studies to compare with our\n\nenriched gene set. Iyer et al. identified 40 transcription factor genes enriched in class I\n\nand/or class IV da neurons compared to whole larvae6. Our enriched gene set contains 6 of\n\nthese 40 genes, a moderate but significant over-representation (Fisher\u2019s exact test", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
