The ORAI2, MAP3K7, ZNF91 minigene plasmids were gifts from Dr.\n\nJames Manley\u2019s lab 12. The GFP sequence and plasmid backbone for making the minigene-\n\nGFP plasmids were obtained from addgene (#13031). The Kid toxin and the Kis antitoxin\n\nsequences were from addgene (#58299 and #58306). The PUMA DNA fragment was\n\nobtained from addgene (#16588). All plasmids were constructed using the Gibson\n\nAssembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs).\n\nCell handling and transfection\n\nHEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM media (Thermo Fisher Scientific)\n\nsupplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. For all overexpression experiments,\n\n58\n\n300,000 cells were seeded to each well of a six-well plate. On the next day, 2ug of total\n\nplasmid DNA were transfected to each well using jetPRIME Transfection Reagent\n\n(Polyplus) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nK562 WT and MT cells were maintained in RPMI media (Cytiva) supplemented with\n\n10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. For all overexpression experiments, media was refreshed two\n\ndays prior to the transfection. On the day of transfection, 1 million cells were carefully\n\nresuspended in 100uL of room-temperature supplemented Nucleofector Solution and\n\ntransferred to the provided cuvette (Lonza). Cells were then nucleofected using the T-016\n\nprogram on the Nucleofector 2b (Lonza) and immediately transferred to pre-warmed\n\nmedia in a 6-well plate.\n\nMinigene assay\n\nMinigene overexpression experiments and the subsequent reverse transcription\n\nwere conducted as described by Zhang et al. 12\n\nWestern Blot\n\nWhole cell lysates were dissolved in homemade RIPA buffer and protein\n\nconcentrations were calibrated using the BCA Assay (Thermo Scientific). Protein was then\n\nran on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BIO-RAD), followed by\n\nimmunoblotting with primary and secondary antibodies. Antibodies used were: anti-GFP\n\nantibody (Life Technologies, A11122), anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
