It starts with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interacting with RNA, followed by digestion and mass spectrometry to identify the site of crosslinking. The identified sites are then compared with a PTM database to determine if PTMs are present at the crosslink domain.\n\n**Panel B**: This heatmap shows the count of various types of PTMs within 10 residues of crosslink locations. The intensity of the color represents the count, with darker shades indicating higher counts.\n\n**Panel C**: This bar graph illustrates the distribution of the number of PTMs at crosslink sites across different RBPs. The majority of RBPs have a lower count of PTMs at crosslink sites, with a few exceptions, such as hnRNPC, which has a higher count.\n\n**Panel D**: This bar graph shows the positions of cancer mutations, mass spectrometry RNA-binding sites, and all modifications in the hnRNPC protein. The protein domains, including RRM (RNA recognition motif) and NLS (nuclear localization signal), are marked, and the modifications are color-coded based on their type (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, etc.).\n\n**Panel E**: This structural representation of hnRNP-C highlights the positions of modified residues, color-coded by PTM type. Two angles of the protein structure are shown, detailing the spatial arrangement of PTMs (such as acetylation, phosphorylation, etc.) in relation to the RNA binding regions.\n\nThe image collectively provides an in-depth look at the relationship between PTMs and crosslink sites in RBPs, with a specific focus on hnRNP-C, illustrating how modifications are distributed and their potential relevance to cancer mutations and RNA interactions.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-42-6.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
