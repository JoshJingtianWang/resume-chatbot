This observation is very exciting as the accounts of direct competition\n\nbetween PTM deposition and RNA binding are scarce, despite reports that PTM\n\n31\n\nmodifications can alter protein structure when deposited at sites other than the direct\n\nRNA\u2013protein interface70. Further, some types of RNA-binding proteins have been found to\n\nbe intrinsically disordered, particularly in non-RNA-binding regions, and these disordered\n\nregions contain more PTM sites71 and as such these interactions could serve as important\n\nrelationships between PTMs and protein/RNA regulation to be further explored.\n\nInspection of the proteins with higher overlap revealed central RBPs that control\n\nnumerous RNA processing functions. In particular, hnRNP proteins have a significant\n\namount of cross link sites that are proximal to PTM sites (Supplementary Table 2-S5). The\n\nmean distance from a PTM to the nearest crosslink site is significantly shorter in hnRNPs\n\n(36 residues) versus all other RBPs (268.4 residues; t-test P-value < 2.2e\u201316). We worked\n\nto analyze PTM sites at RNA\u2013protein crosslinks from available crystal structures in the\n\nPDB. Among those, hnRNP-C stood out due to the high number of PTMs and those that\n\nintersect with cross link peptides from RNA\u2013protein crosslinking experiments (Figure 2-\n\n5C). In total hnRNP-C has 63 PTM sites and 28 of them fall within the annotated RNA\n\nrecognition domain (Figure 2-5D). hnRNP-C is a centralized RNA binding protein as part of\n\na larger class of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear\n\nribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). hnRNP-C has been demonstrated to be associated with\n\nassociated with pre-mRNAs in the nucleus and appear to influence pre-mRNA processing\n\nand polyA tailing72,73.
