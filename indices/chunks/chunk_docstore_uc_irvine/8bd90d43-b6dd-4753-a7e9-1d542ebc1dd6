She cared about me not only academically but also personally. She was not only my mentor but also someone to confide in.\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Norma Frizzell and Dr. Geraldo Piroli. I was such a novice in science, but they treated me with patience. They played an instrumental role in shaping the biologist I am today.\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Robert Spitale, for providing me with freedom and guidance during my PhD. I would like to thank him for injecting energy and enthusiasm into the lab. His passion and drive are an inspiration for me not only in science but also in life.\n\nI would also like to thank my committee members: Drs. Celia Goulding, Scott Atwood, Klemens Hertel, and Olga Razorenova, for their words of advice and encouragement during our multiple meetings.\n\nI would like to thank all current and past members of the Spitale Lab. I thank Dr. Whitney England, for teaching me so much about data analysis. She is the \u201cfull-stack\u201d bioinformatician that I aspire to be. I thank Dr. Kim Nguyen, for her endless support, both technically and emotionally. She made me the biologist that I am today. I thank Dr. Jan Zimak, for changing the way I do experiments. Without his help, my splicing paper would not have been possible. I thank Dr. Sam Levine, Dr. Naoki Hida, Dr. Devon Pendlebury, Monika, Leslie, Abigail, Jay, Callie, Natalie, and Chely. All of you have helped me in some way. Thank you.\n\nI thank my parents, Ronghui and Guanrong, and all my friends in China, South Carolina, and California. Sometimes just a text or call from them got me through the toughest days.\n\nLast but not least, I thank my girlfriend Jaclyn for being someone I can always depend on. She has been incredibly supportive during my PhD and I am so glad she is in my life. To our cat Emma, thank you for always cheering me up.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
