Also, for clarification, from this point forward all vectors described in this study\n\ncontain dual regulators (TetR and rtTA3), which constitutes the O-TetR-A Tet-ON inducible\n\nsystem.\n\nAs we shortened the promoter, we primarily addressed two of the three\n\naforementioned promoter differences, specifically, # 3 and also # 2 regarding the primary\n\nsequence variation between Long-YB-TATA and minYB-TATA. In our new vector design, the\n\nminYB-TATA promoter has 33 nt instead of 61 nt as in the original, counting from the first\n\nnucleotide of its TATA box to the last base right upstream of the start codon (Table S1).\n\nAccompanying with shortening the promoter, the T-richness signal, normally located\n\nupstream to a start codon and associated with high promoter activity in constitutive &\n\nregulated genes23, also decreases. Therefore, the constitutive expressing nature of the\n\npromoter (or the leakiness) is predicted to reduce with mCherry signal highest in miniCMV\n\n(13 Ts) then YB-TATA (7 Ts) and lastly minYB-TATA (2 Ts).\n\nBy microscopy and immunoblot analyses, HEK 293T cells transfected with minYB-\n\nTATA showed no change or below detectable signal in basal expression but also decreased\n\nin the overall induced mCherry signal (Figure 4-2c and Figure 4-S1), indicating the new\n\ndesign reached the distance and T-richness limit for optimal promoter activity. Overall, the\n\n75\n\nobservation agrees with our prediction, and also this vector can be used as a starting\n\npromoter design for screening TATA box sequences (aforementioned promoter difference\n\n#1) contributing to highest promoter activity.\n\nInstead of relying on typical reported TATA box consensus sequences of 5-7 nt, we\n\nused 8 nt consensus sequences supported by the evidence of the TATA binding protein (TBP)\n\ncrystal structure in complex with 8 nt TATA box24,25 and by the report of Basehoar et al.26.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
