Retina washed three times in\n\nPBS, and then placed in 300\u2009\u03bcL tyramide Cy3 1:125 in amplification buffer (Perkin Elmer)\n\nfor 10\u2009min. Retinal sections were washed with PBS three times, and DAPI was added\n\n(1:1000 dilution in PBS) for 10\u2009min to stain the nuclei. Retina washed two times with PBS,\n\nand mounted on slides. Imaging done using a Zeiss Confocal microscope.\n\nImmunocytochemistry of dissociated retina\n\nRetina were isolated and dissociated using trypsin 100X stock and incubation at\n\n37\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Trypsin inhibitor and 1000X DNase I were added to sample and incubated\n\nat 37\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Complete culture medium was then added, and cells were transferred to\n\nchamber slides. The chamber slides were prepared with 1Xpoly-L-lysine incubated for\n\n5\u2009min. Cells were allowed to incubate on the slides for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Then, media was\n\naspirated, and cells were fixed using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Slides\n\nwashed with PBS twice. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at\n\n4\u2009\u00b0C. Mouse anti-calbindin antibody (C-9848, Sigma) was used at 1:100, rabbit anti-\n\nrecoverin antibody (AB5585, Millipore) was used at 1:5000 dilution, mouse anti-pH3\n\nantibody (H6409, Sigma) was used at 1:200 dilution, mouse anti-syntaxin antibody (S0664,\n\nSigma) was used at 1:500 dilution, mouse anti-glutamine synthetase (610518, BD\n\nBiosciences) was used at 1:100 dilution, rabbit anti-cone-arrestin antibody (AB15282,\n\nMillipore) was used at 1:5000 dilution, and sheep anti-chx10 antibody (X1180P, Exalpha\n\nBiological) was used at 1:200 dilution.
