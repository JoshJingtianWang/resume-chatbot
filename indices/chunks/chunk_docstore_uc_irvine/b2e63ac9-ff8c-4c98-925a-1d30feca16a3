The mRNA levels correlate with HELLS\n\nprotein expression, with high expression of HELLS protein during the proliferative stages\n\nof retinal development (E15.5-P2), followed by a steep decrease that falls under the limits\n\nof detection after retinal cell-fate specification has been completed at P6 (Figure 5-1C, D).\n\nThe expression pattern of HELLS in the developing retina suggests that HELLS is expressed\n\nfrom an early stage of retinogenesis and likely required during cell-fate specification and\n\ndifferentiation.\n\nHells is nonessential for normal retinal development\n\nTo elucidate the function of HELLS during retinal development, we generated\n\ngenetically engineered mice to ablate the Hells gene (Figure 5-2A) in early retinal\n\nprogenitors using the Chx10-Cre allele (Chx10-Cre; Hellslox/lox; referred hereafter\n\nas Hells cKO). The Hells cKO mouse model used in this study targets exon 12, which\n\ncontains the conserved helicase domain IV. Since Chx10-Cre is expressed in a mosaic\n\npattern in progenitor cells, we generated mice that also carry the Z/EG transgene to serve\n\nas a reporter for Cre recombination. Retinal cells that arise from the early progenitor cells\n\nthat stochastically expressed Cre recombinase during early development will express\n\nenhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Western blot analysis using P0 retinae, the\n\npostnatal stage with highest HELLS expression in wild-type retinae, confirmed a significant\n\n102\n\ntwofold reduction in HELLS protein levels in retinae expressing Chx10-Cre compared\n\nwith Cre-negative littermate controls (Figure 5-2B). A short form of HELLS protein was not\n\nobserved using a rabbit antibody against the N-terminal sequence of HELLS, suggesting\n\nthat truncated HELLS protein is not stable or below limit of detection.
