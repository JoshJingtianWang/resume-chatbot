The chart is divided into two main sections:\n\n1. **Top 60 Genes Enriched by PNS EC-Tagging:**\n   - The genes are color-coded based on their associated tissues or functions:\n     - Yellow: Neural (PNS)\n     - Orange: Neural\n     - Blue: Muscle\n     - Green: Epidermis\n     - Black: Ubiquitous\n     - Grey: Unknown\n\n2. **Top 60 Genes Depleted by PNS EC-Tagging:**\n   - The same color-coding is used to categorize the genes based on their relevant tissues or functions.\n\nThe background colors in each section help to quickly identify the tissue or functional association of each gene. Some cells are filled with abbreviations or gene names, showing how these genes are distributed across different categories.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-152-27.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
