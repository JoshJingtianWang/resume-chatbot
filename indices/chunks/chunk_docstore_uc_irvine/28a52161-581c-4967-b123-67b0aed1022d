The right panel of Figure 4-5b showed cell density dropped in all except the\n\nnegative control empty vector, demonstrating deathly effect of DTA toxin when expressed.\n\nTo quantify toxic effect of DTA toxin, flow analysis was employed. HEK293 cells were\n\ntransfected with both Lonza pMAX-GFP and one of the DTA-containing plasmids or DTA-free\n\n(empty control) vector. After 72h post induction, cells were subjected to flow cytometry\n\nanalysis: high or low GFP signal serves as a visual tracker of functional or dysfunctional\n\nprotein synthesis, respectively. Without induction, DTA toxin should not express, thus GFP\n\n82\n\nsignal will be high (Figure 4-5C-Left, dark green bars), and upon induction, DTA toxin\n\nexpresses and disrupts protein synthesis, thus causing reduction of GFP signal. Since empty\n\nvector control has no DTA, no reduction of GFP was observed (Figure 4-5C-Left light green\n\nbars); however, comparing to empty vector, Long-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A exhibited reduction\n\nof GFP signal suggesting low level noise remained. When comparing to the other two DTA-\n\ncontaining vectors in un-induced cells, Long-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A decreased basal\n\nexpression by 5 folds than the O-rtTA3 version simply due to the presence of additional TetR\n\nregulator and 8 folds than the miniCMV O-TetR-A vector due to different promoter.\n\nUpon induction, the reduction of GFP signal from Long-SV40-TATA (O-TetR-A) was\n\nnot as low comparing to the other constructs (Figure 4-5C-Left, light green bars). Perhaps,\n\ndue to robust induction of DTA expression by the Long-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A vector, the\n\ntoxin effectively inhibits the host protein synthesis and consequently inhibits its own\n\nproduction.\n\nBecause DTA is an extremely toxic protein, with one molecule being sufficient to shut\n\ndown protein production and kill the cell38, the tight control of DTA expression is especially", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
