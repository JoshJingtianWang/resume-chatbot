We replaced the 8 nt synthetic YB-TATA in the minYB-\n\nTATA promoter with these 8 nt TATA box variants resulting three new mCherry expression\n\nvectors: (a) CMV-TATA, (b) SV40-TATA and (c) TK-TATA (Table S2). Along with minYB-\n\nTATA vector, they were subjected to microscopy, immunoblot analysis and flow cytometry.\n\nBoth CMV and YB-TATA boxes share seven identical nucleotides except the 8th\n\nposition. Given everything else in the minimal promoters stayed the same and yet with just\n\none residue changed: a \u201cG\u201d in the CMV and a \u201cT\u201d in the synthetic YB-TATA, a strike contrast\n\nin mCherry expression was observed. In this promoter context, a \u201cG\u201d at the 8th position of the\n\nCMV TATA box sequence (TATATAAG) is detrimental to promoter function, suggesting the\n\ninteraction between TBP and TATA box was at suboptimal level. The result from this\n\nexperiment also showcased that the 8 nt TATA box with a \u201cT\u201d at the last position from YB-\n\nTATA (TATATAAT) is the candidate of choice (Figure 4-3b-c). Surprisingly, both TK-TATA\n\n(ATATTAAG) and SV-TATA box (TATTTATG) sequences which are deviated from the\n\ncanonical TATA box consensus sequences also showed high level of mCherry expression.\n\nStrikingly, SV40-TATA displayed much higher signal than minYB-TATA. All, as predicted,\n\n76\n\nshowed little or no detectable signal in un-induced (0 Dox), even when imaging was\n\nperformed with long exposure (2 seconds) (Figure 4-3c).\n\nTo isolate the best TATA box that demonstrates both robust mCherry expression and\n\nminimal leakiness, we analyzed mCherry expression from un-induced and induced cells", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
