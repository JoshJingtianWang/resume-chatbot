Minigene plasmids were acquired from Jian\n\nZhang and James Manley. Jingtian Wang designed and cloned all the plasmids and\n\nconducted all the experiments.

These strategies are reliant on cancer\n\ncells displaying the hallmarks of cancer. Cancers frequently carry mutations in their\n\nsplicing machinery which leads to the production of aberrant mRNA transcript. Here, we\n\nengineered a mis-spliced mRNA transcript to respond to a hotspot mutation in splicing\n\nfactor protein SF3B1. We demonstrated that this splicing-responsive RNA switch can be\n\nshrunken down to ~200bp in size and can enable specific protein expression in cells\n\nharboring K700E or several other mutations in SF3B1. When the Kid toxin is fused\n\ndownstream of the RNA switch, it can specifically kill cancer cells carrying the SF3B1\n\nK700E mutation. This RNA switch offers a novel strategy to target the faulty biochemistry\n\nof proteins in cancer cells.\n\n45\n\n3.3 Introduction\n\nOne of the great remaining challenges in cancer therapy is the design of drugs that\n\nwill selectively kill cancer cells and leave healthy cells unharmed.
