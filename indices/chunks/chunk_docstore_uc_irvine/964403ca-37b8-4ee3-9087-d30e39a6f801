Cells were re-suspended and incubated on ice\n\nfor 0.5h then subjected to 5 cycles of freeze-thaw using dry-ice and 22oC water bath, then\n\nfollowed with cell shearing (15 times) to further break cells using 20G x1 \u00bd (0.9mm x 40mm)\n\nneedle (BD PrecisionGlide Needle, Ref# 305179) and 1mL syringe. Total protein lysate was\n\ncleared by centrifugation at 15K rpm for 30min at 4oC. The cleared lystate was subjected to\n\nBCA assay (BioSciences, Cat# 786-570) to determine protein concentration according to\n\nmanufacturer instruction at 37oC for 30 min and quantified using NanoDrop BCA program.\n\n87\n\nSDS-PAGE analysis was performed: 2.5 \u03bcg of total protein per well was resolved in 4-\n\n20% gradient 10-well MiniProtean gel (Bio-Rad, Cat# 4561094). Proteins were transferred\n\nonto nitrocellulose membrane using Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer unit (Bio-Rad,\n\nCat#1704150). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in 1xPBST (1xPBS: 137\n\nmM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, and 2 mM KH2PO4 + 0.1%Tween-20) for 1h at room\n\ntemperature and probed overnight at 4oC with fresh blocking buffer + mouse anti-His\n\n(GenScript, Cat#: A00186-100) at 1:2000dil. Blot was washed 3x10min/each with 1xPBST\n\nat room temperature (RT) and incubated in 1xPBST+ 5% non-fat dry milk + anti-mouse\n\nconjugated Horseradish peroxidase (1:20000 dilution) (Cell Signaling, MA, USA; Cat# 7076S)\n\nfor 1h at RT. Finally, blot was washed 3x10min/each with 1xPBST at RT and imaged using\n\nECL Chemiluminescent Substrate (Fisher Scientific, Cat# PI32106) and imaged on a\n\nChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad).\n\nFlow cytometry\n\n24h or 48h post induction, cells were lifted with 0.5% Trypsin-EDTA (Fisher\n\nScientific, Cat# 15400054) and re-suspended in room-temperature flow buffer (1xPBS with\n\n5% FBS). Fluorescence was measured in the NovoCyte Flow Cytometer (Agilent).\n\n4.6 Supplemental Data", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
