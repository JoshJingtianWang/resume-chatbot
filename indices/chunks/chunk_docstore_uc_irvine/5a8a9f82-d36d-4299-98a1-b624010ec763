The O-Tet-RA system design, cloning and testing\n\nwas done by Kim Nguyen and Myhanh Nguyen. Experiments involving Diphtheria toxin\n\nand flow cytometry (Figure 4-2b, Figure 4-3d, g, Figure 4-4, Figure 4-5b, c) were done by\n\nJingtian Wang. Several mini promoter ideas were offered by Jan Zimak. Manuscript writing\n\nwas done by Kim Nguyen and commented by Jingtian Wang. The project was supervised by\n\nRobert Spitale.\n\n4.2 Abstract\n\nThe ability to control when and where a target gene expressed often employs an\n\ninducible transcription system. Tet-inducible (Tet-ON and Tet-OFF) vectors are widely\n\nadopted to such studies due to its robustness. However, inherited level of leakiness in\n\nclassic design of Tet-inducible system has limited its usage in certain studies such as\n\nregulation of T-cell activation or suicide gene expression. In this study, we re-designed Tet-\n\nON inducible system and subjected the novel system to different stringent tests including\n\nexpression of Diptheria toxin to assess both its robustness and leakiness. We demonstrated\n\nthat the new Tet-ON design called Long-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A system comprised of novel\n\npromoter design and dual tetracycline regulators effectively respond to low Doxycycline", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
