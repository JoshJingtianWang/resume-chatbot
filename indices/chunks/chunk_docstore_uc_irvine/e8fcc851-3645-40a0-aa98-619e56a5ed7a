We provide the first\n\ncomparison of PTM data in the context of in-cell captured RNA\u2013protein crosslinks. This is\n\ncritical to understand if there is an overlap between the sites of PTM deposition and RNA\n\nbinding. Through this analysis, the complexity of RNA recognition motifs, experimentally\n\nvalidated, and the relationship of PTM sites is revealed. PTM complexity and number of the\n\nhnRNP proteins, a critically important class of RBPs, comes to light. Highlighting this\n\n35\n\nrelationship suggests an enrichment for arginine methylation among these proteins,\n\nsuggesting that neutralization of the arginine positive charge could be critically important\n\nfor controlling the RBP\u2013RNA interface. Such analysis in a fuller context of these\n\nmodifications and their relationship to controlled RBP function will be invaluable to fully\n\nunderstand their roles.\n\nFinally, we provide the community with an online database that is fully searchable.\n\nWe hope this database, and the analyses herein provide a catalyst for experiments to fully\n\nunderstand the role of PTMs in regulating RBP and RNA function.\n\n2.7 Data Availability\n\nThe web interface to the database is available at: http://PTM-RBP-\n\nATLAS.igb.uci.edu/.
