Biological replicates\n\nwere prepared by carrying out 5EC, 5EUd, or mock feeding, carcass dissections and RNA\n\nprocessing independently. Larvae were reared at 25\u00b0C and fed 1 mM 5EC or 5EUd from 72\u2013\n\n84 hours after hatching. Total carcass RNA was extracted using Trizol. For each treatment,\n\nduplicate 20 \u03bcg RNA samples (obtained from 25\u201330 carcasses) were biotinylated using\n\nClick-iT Nascent RNA Capture reagents (ThermoFisher) and purified on Dynabeads MyOne\n\nStreptavidin T1 magnetic beads (ThermoFisher) as previously described8. After the final\n\nwash, beads were combined with NuGen Ovation Universal RNA-Seq reagents, following\n\nthe manufacturer\u2019s protocol beginning at first strand cDNA synthesis. Primer annealing and\n\n149\n\ncDNA synthesis was performed in a heated lid thermomixer to ensure beads did not settle.\n\nAfter cDNA synthesis, beads were washed three times with 500 \u03bcl 1X PBS, discarding the\n\nsupernatant each time. Beads were resuspended in 50 \u03bcl RNaseA/T1/H elution mix (1X\n\nRNAse H buffer, 12.5 mM D-biotin, RNase A/T1 cocktail (0.1 U/\u03bcl), RNase H (0.1 U/\u03bcl)) and\n\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes at 1,000 rpm in a thermomixer. The reaction was stopped\n\nby adding 1 \u03bcl of DMSO and heating at 95\u00b0C for 4 minutes. Beads were collected on a\n\nmagnet and the supernatant was mixed with DNA binding buffer and applied to a Zymogen\n\nDNA Clean and Concentrator-5 column to purify first-strand cDNA. Following purification,\n\nthe duplicate samples were combined into a single tube and the volume was reduced to 10\n\n\u03bcl using a SpeedVac concentrator. The samples were then used to make second-strand\n\ncDNA according to the NuGen Ovation Universal RNA-Seq protocol, including adapter\n\nligation and ribosomal RNA depletion using a Drosophila-specific AnyDeplete rRNA primer\n\nmixture. Libraries were amplified and purified according to the NuGen protocol and quality", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
