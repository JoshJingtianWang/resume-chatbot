In recent years, the existence of cancer stem cells\n\n(CSCs) has become increasingly accepted2. CSCs are a subpopulation of cancer cells that\n\ndisplay enhanced self-renewal and tumorigenic capacity. Because of CSCs\u2019 slow\n\nproliferation and lack of typical cancer surface markers, they are largely resistant to and\n\nbecome enriched after traditional chemotherapies and targeted therapies3. Recent work\n\nsuggests that after chemotherapies, CSCs may enter a dormant state that leads to cancer\n\nrecurrence4,5 As such, there is an urgent need for novel cancer therapies that specifically\n\ntarget cancer cells independent of the traditional hallmarks of cancer.\n\nCancer gene therapies\n\nThus far, 65% of all gene therapy trials have been aimed at treating cancer6. The\n\nvery first commercialized cancer gene therapy, Gendicine, which dates back to 2003, is a\n\nrecombinant adenovirus engineered to express wild type p53 to treat head and neck\n\n1\n\nsquamous cell cancer7. Since entering the market, Gendicine has been administered to\n\nmore than 30,000 patients, demonstrating superior efficacy and safety compared to\n\nstandard therapy8; however, Gendicine has no targeting mechanism and exclusively treats\n\np53-responsive cancers. The overwhelming majority of gene therapies are still in phase I\n\nand phase I/II of clinical trials6. The biggest challenge of cancer gene therapies is treating\n\npatients in a cancer cell-specific manner without inflicting damage on the normal tissues9.\n\nCurrently, the specificity of cancer gene therapies is primarily achieved in two ways:\n\ncancer-specific promoters and targeted delivery10.\n\nTissue/cancer-specific promoters (TCP) can be used for targeted transgene\n\nexpression, however, TCPs such as hTERT are also active in germline cells and stem cells,\n\ninflicting adverse effects on the patients11. Furthermore, TCPs often require enhancers,", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
