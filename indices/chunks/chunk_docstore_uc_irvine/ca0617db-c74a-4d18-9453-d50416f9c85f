Herein, we\n\nperform a thorough analysis of experimentally derived PTMs. Using recent large-scale\n\ndatasets for the identification of RNA binding proteins, we investigate PTMs on the set of\n\nknown RBPs (RBP-ome). We intersect this dataset with published protein\u2013protein\n\ninteraction databases to provide potential models for how PTMs are deposited and\n\nremoved by cellular enzymes. We utilize mass spectrometry data on in-cell crosslinked\n\nRNA\u2013protein interactions, that are close to identified RNA\u2013protein interfaces, to provide\n\n15\n\nthe community with PTMs that have the potential to regulate RNA\u2013protein binding. We\n\ninvestigate the potential disease relevance of PTM sites by intersecting our data with The\n\nCancer Genome Atlas. We catalog novel PTM sites that are mutated in these datasets and\n\nprovide experimentally-derived evidence that a key and well known RBP is mutated in\n\ncancer. Finally, we provide the community with an online searchable database (http://PTM-\n\nRBP-ATLAS.igb.uci.edu) where this data can be easily gathered by the community for\n\ninspection to help with their research programs. Overall, we envision the data generated\n\nherein will serve as a powerful analysis for the growing labs interested in understanding\n\nhow RBPs control the fate of RNA molecules.\n\n2.4 Materials and Methods\n\nAggregation of PTM sites, RNA-binding proteins, and protein\u2013protein interactions\n\nKnown sites of post-translational modifications in human proteins were\n\ndownloaded from 13 public PTM databases covering a variety of PTM types: dbSNO, HPRD,\n\nMeMo, OGlycBase, PHOSIDA, PhosphoELM, Phosphositeplus, PTM_SD, RedoxDB,\n\nSwissPalm, Swiss-Prot, SysPTM and UbiProt21\u201333.
