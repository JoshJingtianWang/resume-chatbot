Our prior EC-tagging work8 used a\n\nmicroarray platform and focused on relatively large populations of cells (all neurons of the\n\ncentral nervous system, mushroom body neurons); in contrast, this work demonstrates\n\nthat EC-tagging can be combined with RNA-seq and is sensitive enough to identify\n\ntranscripts in a rare neuronal population.
