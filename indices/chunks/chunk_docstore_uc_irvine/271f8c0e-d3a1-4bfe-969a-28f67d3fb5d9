Here is a detailed summary:\n\n1. **Panels A and B**: These panels show Western blots comparing the levels of HELLS and TUBULIN proteins in wild-type (wt) and Rb/p107 knockout (Rblp107) conditions in P21 and tumor tissues, respectively. The blots demonstrate higher levels of HELLS in the knockout conditions compared to wild-type.\n\n2. **Panel C**: This bar graph illustrates the relative fold enrichment of HELLS promoter binding by E2F1 in different retinal conditions (wt retinas, Rb/p107 (Cre), Rb/p107 DKO, and Weri). The data shows significant enrichment in Rb/p107 DKO and Weri, indicating increased promoter activity in these conditions.\n\n3. **Panels D and E**: These panels present Western blots showing the levels of HELLS and TUBULIN across various developmental stages (E17.5, P0, P2, P4, P6, P14, and P21) in Rb1 cKO and Rb/p107 DKO mice, respectively. The blots reveal dynamic changes in HELLS protein levels during development.\n\n4. **Panel F**: This line graph depicts the relative HELLS protein levels normalized to TUBULIN across different developmental stages in Rb/p107 DKO and wild-type mice. The graph indicates fluctuations in HELLS protein levels over time.\n\n5. **Panel G**: This bar graph shows the relative mRNA levels of Hells across the same developmental stages, normalized to wild-type E17.5 levels. There is an increasing trend in Hells mRNA levels, particularly in the later stages (P6 and P14).\n\n6. **Panel H**: This genomic plot displays the chromosomal location of HELLS with tracks showing the read density of EGFP- and EGFP+ cells in Rb/p107 DKO mice. The plot highlights differential expression or binding patterns in these cell populations.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-119-22.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
