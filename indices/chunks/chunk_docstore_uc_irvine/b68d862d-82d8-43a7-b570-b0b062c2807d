Whitney England was the main analyst for this paper.\n\nJingtian Wang queried the TCGA mutational data, conducted the GO-term analysis of the\n\nRBPs, and contributed to the analyses in Figure 2-2, 2-3, 2-4. Siwei Chen built the web\n\ninterface to the database. Ryan Flynn conducted the mass spectrometry experiments.\n\nPierre Baldi supervised the website and database building. Robert Spitale supervised the\n\nrest of the analysis and did the writing.\n\n2.2 Abstract\n\nRNA structure and function are intimately tied to RNA binding protein recognition\n\nand regulation. Posttranslational modifications are chemical modifications which can", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
