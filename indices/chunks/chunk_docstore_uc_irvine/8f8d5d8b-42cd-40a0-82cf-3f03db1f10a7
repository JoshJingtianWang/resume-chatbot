The blot was\n\nprobed with anti-His Ab and displayed robust 6xHis-mCherry signal in all induced samples\n\nas well as the un-induced sample from the classic single regulator containing O-rtTA3\n\nsystem. However, the un-induced miniCMV containing O-TetR-A vector showed a much\n\nlower signal of 6xHis-mCherry, reconfirming the advantage of the dual regulator containing\n\nO-TetR-A system over the single regulator containing O-rtTA3 system in noise reduction.\n\nExcitingly, 6xHis-mCherry signal was not detectable in the un-induced sample derived from\n\ncells transfected with the synthetic Long-YB-TATA containing O-TetR-A vector (Figure 4-2c).\n\nTogether, these results and differences of the two promoters including (1) TATA box, (2) the\n\nprimary sequences and (3) the distance between the TATA box and ATG translation start\n\ncodon (Table S1) indicate the contribution of these differences in reduction of basal\n\nexpression.\n\nNovel promoter designs enable tightly and robustly controlled gene expression\n\nTo further improve the O-TetR-A expression system, we aimed to develop a minimal\n\npromoter that gives lowest basal expression but robustly expresses upon induction by\n\ntackling the differences of promoters discussed above. To that end, first we focused on our\n\n74\n\nbest working Long-YB-TATA promoter in the O-TetR-A expression vector by further\n\ntrimming the distance between its TATA box and the start codon to a bare minimal which\n\nresulted the minYB-TATA promoter (Table S1). We reasoned that by decreasing the distance\n\nbetween TATA box and the start codon, we would also reduce features, indicative of the\n\nhighest promoter activity normally located within the region of 75 nt upstream and 50 nt\n\ndownstream of the main transcription start site23; therefore, we would further decrease\n\nbasal noise.
