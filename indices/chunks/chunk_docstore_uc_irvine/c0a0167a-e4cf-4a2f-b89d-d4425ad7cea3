In short, we have established a range of Dox working\n\nconcentrations for the O-TetR-A system that is lower than the currently recommended\n\nconcentration for Tet-inducible systems. Consequently, potential confounding effects caused\n\nby Doxycycline toxicity on mitochondrial functions due to usage of high Dox concentration\n\ncan be reduced.\n\nLong-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A system withstands stringent challenge in expression\n\nDiptheria toxin\n\n81\n\nTo further challenge the Long-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A system, we replaced mCherry\n\ncoding sequence with an exotoxin gene encoded by a lysogenic corynephage \u03b2 which infected\n\nall pathogenic bacterial strains, Corynebacterium diptheriae30\u201333. The gene encodes for\n\nDiptheria toxin fragment A (DTA) which inhibits protein synthesis in host cells when\n\nexpressed by inactivating an essential factor in protein synthesis, eukaryotic elongation\n\nfactor 2 (eEF2) via ADP-ribosylation a dipthamide residue of eEF234\u201337. In this experiment,\n\nwe also cloned DTA into miniCMV promoter containing O-TetR-A vector and Long-SV40-\n\nTATA promoter containing O-rtTA3 for comparison (Figure 4-5a).\n\nLive cell imaging analysis of HEK293 cells transfected with one of the three DTA-\n\ncontaining plasmids demonstrated how well the novel design of the Long-SV40-TATA O-\n\nTetR-A vector performed. Without induction (Figure 4-5B-left panel), both constructs of the\n\nLong-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A and the empty vector control (top & bottom) had high density of\n\ncells indicating DTA toxin had not expressed. However, a great drop in cell density was\n\nobserved in cells transfected with either the Long-SV40-TATA promoter in single regulator-\n\ncontaining O-rtTA3 plasmid or the miniCMV promoter in dual regulator-containing O-TetR-\n\nA vector, suggesting DTA toxin had been expressed and caused cell death even when un-\n\ninduced.
