We found that Hells-\n\n117\n\nnull mature (P21) retina display normal retinal cell specification and differentiation\n\ncompared with their littermate controls. This suggests that HELLS is either unnecessary for\n\nretinal differentiation and development or its loss of function is compensated by other\n\nchromatin remodeling proteins.\n\nThe only difference we noted in Hells cKO retinae was a modest abnormal\n\nlamination of bipolar cells when compared with the surrounding Cre-negative tissue and\n\nlittermate controls. Bipolar cells are the last cell type to terminally differentiate in the\n\nmouse retina, around postnatal day 6 when Hells expression is seen to decrease in the wild-\n\ntype retina. It is possible that transcriptional repression of Hells helps orchestrate bipolar\n\ncell migration such that when HELLS is not present, lamination of bipolar cells is slightly\n\naltered. Despite this mild developmental defect, ERG measurements of the electrical\n\nactivity of the retina in response to light stimulation indicated that Hells-null retina\n\nfunction is unaltered.\n\nHells is downregulated by Rb and p107 during late retinal differentiation\n\nOther groups and we have identified HELLS as a transcriptional downstream target\n\ngene of E2F1 that is overexpressed in cancer and contributes to tumor progression9,10,30.\n\nThe evidence of direct regulation of HELLS by the RB family was limited to in vitro studies\n\nin gliomas and osteosarcoma7,9. In this study, we confirmed that the RB/E2F signaling\n\npathway directly regulates transcriptional activation of HELLS in the developing retinae.\n\nChIP analysis revealed enrichment of E2F1 at a known binding area on the promoter region\n\nof HELLS8 in retinal tissue during early development or in the absence of Rb1/p107.\n\nInterestingly, loss of Rb1, unlike humans, is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis in the", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
