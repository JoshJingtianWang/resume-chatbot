The graphs compare control and HELLS cKO mice, showing that HELLS cKO mice have altered scotopic a-wave (G) and b-wave (H) amplitudes, indicating potential functional deficits in the retina.\n\nOverall, the image provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of HELLS gene deletion on retinal structure and function, using a combination of genetic, molecular, and physiological assays.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-115-21.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
