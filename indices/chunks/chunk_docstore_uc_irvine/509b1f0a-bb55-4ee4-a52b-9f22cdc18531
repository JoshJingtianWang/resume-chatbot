Each diagram illustrates the components of the systems, including Tet-O, mCherry, CMV, rtTA(VP16), and TetR, and shows how gene expression is regulated by doxycycline induction. \n\n- **O-rtTA3**: This system shows high background and high expression levels. The rtTA(VP16) is present, and upon Dox induction, it binds to Tet-O and activates mCherry expression.\n- **O-TetR**: This system shows low background and low expression. TetR represses mCherry expression until Dox induction, which then weakly activates mCherry expression.\n- **O-TetR-A**: This system shows low background and high expression. TetR represses mCherry expression until Dox induction, which strongly activates mCherry expression due to the presence of both TetR and rtTA(VP16).\n\n**Panel b**: \nThis panel shows simplified diagrams of the O-rtTA3 and O-TetR-A systems, focusing on the arrangement of Tet-O, mCherry, CMV, rtTA(VP16), and TetR components.\n\n**Panel c**: \nThis panel presents fluorescent images comparing the expression of mCherry in cells transfected with either O-rtTA3 or O-TetR-A systems under different doxycycline concentrations (0 and 0.5 \u03bcg/mL) at 24 and 48 hours. The images show that the O-TetR-A system exhibits higher mCherry expression with doxycycline induction compared to O-rtTA3.\n\n**Panel d**: \nThis panel is a bar graph showing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for O-rtTA3 and O-TetR-A systems. The O-TetR-A system has a significantly higher SNR compared to the O-rtTA3 system, indicating more efficient and specific gene expression with lower background noise.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-82-14.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
