Taken together, we propose that HELLS is\n\na critical downstream mediator of E2F-dependent ectopic division in the Rb1/p107-null\n\nretina (Figure 5-6). In the absence of RB and p107, E2F1 transcriptional derepression\n\ndrives the expression of Hells. HELLS then functions as transcriptional co-activator of E2F3,\n\nstimulating expression of growth promoting genes during G1/S phase transitions27. The\n\nresulting ectopic proliferation of differentiating retinal cells promotes retinoblastoma\n\nformation.\n\n120\n\nFigure 5-6. Model for HELLS function as driver of tumorigenesis in the developing\n\nretina. A. In the normal developing retina, RB or p107 represses E2F1 from driving HELLS\n\nexpression by postnatal day 6 (P6). B. In the absence of RB and p107, E2F1\n\ndrives Hells transcription beyond of P6. HELLS is known to interact physically with E2F3\n\nand function as transcriptional co-activator of E2F3. The resulting HELLS overexpression in\n\nthe absence of RB and p107 mediate expression of several genes that stimulate G1/S\n\ntransition and cell proliferation.\n\nThe decrease in tumor burden and morbidity observed in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice\n\npresents HELLS as an attractive potential therapeutic target for the treatment of\n\nretinoblastoma. This is particularly true given our observations indicating that HELLS\n\nexpression is not essential for normal retinal development and that HELLS is not expressed\n\nin terminally differentiated retinal cells. This suggests that ocular delivery of HELLS\n\ninhibitors might reduce tumor burden with low retinal toxicities.\n\n5.6 Materials and Methods\n\n121\n\nThe data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI\u2019s Gene\n\nExpression Omnibus38 and are accessible through GEO Series accession\n\nnumber GSE144429 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144429).\n\nMouse models\n\nThe Rblox/lox mice were obtained from the Mouse Models of Human Cancer", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
