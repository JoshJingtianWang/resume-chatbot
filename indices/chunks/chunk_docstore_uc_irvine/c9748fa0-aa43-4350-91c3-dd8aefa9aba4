Md neurons have proven useful for investigating the\n\nmolecular mechanisms that control dendrite arborization1. Foundational work used a\n\nmutagenesis screen to identify genes that regulate dendrite arborization2. Others have\n\ntaken a reverse genetics approach and tested candidates through RNA-interference (RNAi)\n\nbased on the functional properties of candidates3,4. The ability to induce neuron-specific\n\nRNAi in Drosophila makes reverse genetics an attractive approach and the efficacy of\n\ncandidate choice can be improved by selecting genes from neuron-specific transcriptome\n\ndata.\n\nTranscriptome profiling of dendritic arborization (da) neurons, a subclass of md\n\nneurons, has been performed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)5 or magnetic\n\nbead-based purification6. These studies used differential expression data to select\n\ncandidates and demonstrated roles for those genes in da neuron dendrite arborization. One\n\ncaveat of physical isolation is that neurons are removed from their natural environment\n\nand undergo processing prior to RNA extraction, possibly inducing transcriptional and\n\n136\n\npost-transcriptional responses that do not reflect in vivo gene expression. An alternative\n\napproach is to use biosynthetic RNA tagging methods that do not require physical isolation\n\nand enrich for nascent and recently-transcribed mRNAs7. These methods use metabolic\n\nlabeling, under in vivo conditions, to generate tagged RNAs in the cells of interest. Tagged\n\nRNAs are subsequently purified from total RNA of animals or tissues. We recently\n\ndescribed a cell type-specific biosynthetic RNA tagging method called EC-tagging8. EC-\n\ntagging works via targeted expression of a nucleobase-converting fusion enzyme composed\n\nof cytosine DEminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CD:UPRT). Metazoans lack\n\ncytosine DEminase activity and have varying endogenous uracil phosphoribosyltransferase", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
