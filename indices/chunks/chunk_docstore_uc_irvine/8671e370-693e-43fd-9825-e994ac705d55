Complicating\n\nthe treatment is the existence of cancer stem cells and quiescent cancer cells that do not\n\ndisplay the typical characteristics of cancer2. Currently, the typical targeting strategies of\n\nviral-based gene therapies largely rely on engineering the viral capsid and the cancer-\n\nspecific promoters, but they come with their own limitations, such as reliance on\n\ntraditional cancer hallmarks and surface receptors3,4.\n\nMy proposed therapy involves an RNA switch that detects several mutations in\n\nSF3B1 that are frequently found in cancers. The basal level of Kid toxin expressed in WT\n\ncells is neutralized by constitutively expressed Kis antitoxin. Moreover, the ORAI2 splicing\n\ncassette can be shrunken down to ~200bp, facilitating the gene therapy design.\n\nInstead of targeting the typical markers of cancer (unchecked proliferation, sustained\n\nangiogenesis, evasion from apoptosis, etc.), my proposed therapy targets the defective\n\nbiochemistry of a pro-oncogenic housekeeping protein5. Therefore, my therapy can\n\nselectively attack cancer cells as long as they harbor the SF3B1 mutation, regardless of\n\nwhether the cancer cells are stem-like, differentiated, actively proliferating, or quiescent.\n\nThe strategy that we developed to clone the Kid toxin expression plasmid achieved\n\nconstitutive expression in mammalian cells without needing an inducible component,\n\nsimplifying the gene therapy design. This strategy provides a platform for the constitutive\n\nmammalian expression of any bacterial toxin that has an antitoxin pair.\n\n155\n\nLastly, the OTetRA inducible gene expression system improves upon the original\n\nTetOn system by eliminating the basal leakiness expression in the \u201coff\u201d state. This tight\n\ngene expression control is especially important for gene therapies that involve highly toxic\n\npayloads such as Kid and Diphtheria toxin.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
