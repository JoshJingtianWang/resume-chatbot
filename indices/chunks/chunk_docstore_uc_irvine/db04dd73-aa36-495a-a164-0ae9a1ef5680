Our enriched gene set contains 6 of\n\nthese 40 genes, a moderate but significant over-representation (Fisher\u2019s exact test\n\ncomparing representation in the EC-RNA dataset to representation in\n\nthe Drosophila genome, p-value = 0.03). Hattori et al. identified 24 genes expressed in class\n\nI and/or class IV da neurons for which RNAi caused dendritic arborization phenotypes5.\n\nOur md neuron enriched gene set contains 10 of these 24 genes, a significant over-\n\nrepresentation (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p-value = 5 x 10\u22126).\n\nCandidate testing identifies novel regulators of md neuron dendrite arborization\n\nWe next sought to test the function of novel candidate genes in md neuron dendrite\n\narborization. We focused on genes encoding mRNA-binding proteins (a significantly\n\nenriched GO category, Figure 6-3)) based on our interest in post-transcriptional control of\n\nmRNA processing13. Out of 20 enriched RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), 10\n\n(rump, fus, bru1, sqd, stau, shep, elav, Fmr1, BicD, and Caper) have previously described\n\nfunctions in md neuron dendrite arborization (based on Flybase annotations or a RNAi\n\nscreen of RBPs4). The RNAi screen of Olesnicki et al. 4tested 7 additional RBPs that we\n\n143\n\nidentified as md neuron-enriched but did not detect any dendrite arborization defects,\n\nsuggesting these RBPs have functions irrelevant to dendrite morphogenesis. We focused on\n\nthe remaining 3 RBPs with no available md neuron information: ythdc1 (also known\n\nas YT521-B), hiiragi (hrg), and hephaestus (heph). Ythdc1 is a nuclear-localized m6A\n\nbinding protein that regulates alternative splicing14. Hiiragi is a poly(A) polymerase that\n\nacts on nascent mRNAs and regulates poly(A) tail length of cytoplasmic mRNAs in\n\noocytes15. Hephaestus is a polypyrimidine tract binding protein that represses translation\n\nof oskar in oocytes16.
