Identification of mis-spliced transcripts suitable for mutant selective\n\nprotein expression. A. HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmid for wild\n\ntype (WT) or K700E (MT) SF3B1, followed by total RNA extraction and RT-PCR of the 3'\n\nsplice sites. Total RNA of HEK293T cells co-transfected with minigenes were RT-PCR'ed for\n\n48\n\nthe 3' splice sites with primers specific to the minigene vectors.
