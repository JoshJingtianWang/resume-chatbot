RNA-RBP\n\ninteractions control and regulate alternative splicing, RNA export and RNA decay. Our\n\nexpanded understanding of the catalog of such interactions suggests each of these\n\nprocesses can be dynamic with the catalog of RBP\u2013RNA interactions changing to toggle\n\nRNA expression for desired cellular output9\u201311. Almost all characterization of RBP\u2013RNA\n\ninteractions has been focused on identifying the protein\u2013RNA interface and have limited\n\nfocus on how the RBPs themselves are regulated to control RNA fate12. There is much work\n\nto be done to fully understand how RBPs select their RNA targets in cells, how signaling\n\nnetworks can control RBP selection, how RBPs themselves are regulated, and how such\n\nregulation can lead to altered RNA expression.\n\nProtein molecules are subject to a high level of regulation through chemical\n\nmodifications termed posttranslational modifications (PTMs)13. PTMs are known to\n\nregulate protein structure, localization, decay and signaling activities14,15. PTMs vary widely\n\nin their chemical nature and can impart unique structural and charge differences\n\nassociated with their deposition and removal. Further, proteins with evidence of multiple\n\nPTMs have been suggested to be more involved in disease biology than poorly modified\n\nproteins16. PTM marks are dynamic and can either be deposited through enzyme-regulated\n\nprocesses or changes in cellular chemistry (i.e. oxidation).
