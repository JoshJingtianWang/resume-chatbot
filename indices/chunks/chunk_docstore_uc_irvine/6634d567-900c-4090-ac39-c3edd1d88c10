It has\n\nbeen observed that PTM sites can be important for regulation of protein\u2013protein\n\ninteractions and regulatory hot spots for signaling in other classes of functional proteins53.\n\nWe worked to better understand if such high conservation would be observed in RNA\n\nbinding proteins as well. Examining the conservation of modified sites, we found that\n\nwithin an RBP, PTM sites were more conserved across vertebrates than randomly-selected\n\nsites in 74.5% of proteins (Figure 2-2E). Across proteins of all types, 74.8% of modified\n\nsites were more conserved, indicating that this high level of conservation is not specific to\n\nRNA-binding proteins. For 38.6% of RBPs and 36.3% of all proteins, the mean conservation\n\nscore is >0.9, indicating a high probability that they lie in elements highly conserved across\n\nspecies, and the higher conservation of PTM sites in RBPs is statistically significant\n\n(Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, P < 2e\u221216). This high evolutionary conservation of many PTM\n\nsites indicates they may have important functions that remain intact through evolutionary\n\ntime.\n\nOverall, our analysis of PTM sites from curated datasets and published manuscripts\n\nsuggests that RBPs have highly complex experimentally observed PTM profiles, that RBPs\n\nhave many different types of PTMs, and that the sites of PTM deposition are highly\n\nconserved. These resources provide a large dataset focused on RNA binding proteins for\n\nanalysis by the community.\n\n22\n\nIdentification of probable PTM-depositing enzymes\n\nFigure 2-3.
