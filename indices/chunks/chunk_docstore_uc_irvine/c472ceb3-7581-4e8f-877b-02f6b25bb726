Hephaestus is a polypyrimidine tract binding protein that represses translation\n\nof oskar in oocytes16. We selected a known md neuron RBP enriched in our dataset, Caper,\n\nas a positive control. Caper regulates alternative splicing and is required for proper\n\ndendrite arborization of the ddaC class IV da neuron17.\n\nWe crossed a single UAS-RNAi line for each gene of interest to Gal4477, UAS-\n\nmCD8::GFP4. The membrane-tethered GFP allowed us to measure the number of dendrite\n\nbranch termini and dendritic field size in ddaC neurons of late L3 larvae. Gal4477 expression\n\nbegins in newly differentiated class IV da neurons of embryos and continues throughout\n\nlarval development18. Gal4477, UAS-mCD8::GFP crossed to wildtype served as a negative\n\ncontrol. Caper RNAi caused a significant increase in dendrite branch termini but no\n\nincrease in dendritic field size since the terminal branches tended to be short and tightly\n\nclustered (Figure 6-4). These Caper RNAi results are very similar to the previously\n\ndescribed Caper loss-of-function phenotype17. For the analysis of ythdc1, we used a\n\npreviously described loss of function mutant19 combined with Gal4477, UAS-mCD8::GFP as\n\nwell as a ythdc1 RNAi line. Neither Ythdc1 loss of function (Figure 6-4) nor ythdc1 RNAi\n\n(data not shown) affected the number of dendrite branch termini or field coverage. In\n\ncontrast, Heph RNAi caused a significant decrease in the number of branch termini and\n\n144\n\nfield size (Figure 6-4). Hrg RNAi also caused a significant decrease in branch termini and\n\nfield size but the termini / field size value was not significantly different from controls\n\n(Figure 6-4). While limited to the individual RNAi lines tested, these results suggest\n\nthat heph knockdown primarily affects branching, resulting in fewer termini and reduced\n\ndendritic field size, while hrg knockdown primarily affects dendrite growth without\n\ndirectly affecting branching.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
