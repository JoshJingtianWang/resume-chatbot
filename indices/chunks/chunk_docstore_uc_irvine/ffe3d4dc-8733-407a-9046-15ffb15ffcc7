Most\n\nRBPs had multiple types of PTMs (Figure 2-2B), with 2074 of the 2381 modified proteins\n\nhaving multiple modification types (87%). RBPs have significantly more PTMs per amino\n\nacid than all proteins (0.1992 versus 0.0181 modifications per amino acid,\n\nStudent's t, P = 4.93 \u00d7 10\u201360). The most common set of modifications was phosphorylation,\n\nubiquitination, acetylation, and methylation (Supplementary Figure 2-S1), followed by\n\nphosphorylation alone or in combination with one or more of the aforementioned\n\nmodifications. In addition, most RBPs (2202) have multiple instances of a PTM type\n\n(Figure 2-2C and D). The vast majority of phosphorylated and ubiquitinated proteins are\n\nmultiply modified (88% and 81%, respectively), while multiple methylation and\n\nacetylation sites are less frequent (58% and 48%, respectively). This data may be the result\n\nof a bias in generated data as phosphorylation profiling is the most common PTM analyzed\n\nin the literature; however, the complexity of PTM classes and their dynamic nature is likely\n\nto contribute to RBP function in development and disease, as has been observed in other\n\nprotein classes13,14,49.\n\nWhile most proteins have a small number of repeated modifications, there is a long\n\ntail of highly modified proteins (Figure 2-2D). Up to 65 acetylation, 75 methylation and 147\n\nubiquitination sites were observed in proteins in this dataset. Phosphorylation in particular\n\n21\n\nexhibits many modifications per protein, with approximately 1% containing at least 100\n\nphosphorylated sites. The most phosphorylated protein, serine-rich SRRM2, contained 587\n\nsites among its 2752 residues, consistent with its known biology to be regulated by\n\ndynamic serine phosphorylation50\u201352.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
