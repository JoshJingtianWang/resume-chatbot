Posttranslational modifications are chemical modifications which can\n\ncontrol protein biology. The role of PTMs in the regulation RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is\n\nnot well understood, in part due to a lacking analysis of PTM deposition on RBPs. Herein,\n\n12\n\nwe present an analysis of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on RNA binding proteins\n\n(RBPs; a PTM RBP Atlas). We curate published datasets and primary literature to\n\nunderstand the landscape of PTMs and use protein\u2013protein interaction data to understand\n\nand potentially provide a framework for understanding which enzymes are controlling\n\nPTM deposition and removal on the RBP landscape. Intersection of our data with The\n\nCancer Genome Atlas also provides researchers understanding of mutations that would\n\nalter PTM deposition. Additional characterization of the RNA\u2013protein interface provided\n\nfrom in-cell UV crosslinking experiments provides a framework for hypotheses about\n\nwhich PTMs could be regulating RNA binding and thus RBP function. Finally, we provide an\n\nonline database for our data that is easy to use for the community. It is our hope that our\n\nefforts will provide researchers with an invaluable tool to test the function of PTMs\n\ncontrolling RBP function and thus RNA biology.\n\n2.3 Introduction\n\nRNA molecules have emerged as critical players in nearly every biological process,\n\nfrom cell division to the regulation of chromatin state and gene expression1,2. Many\n\ndiseases, ranging from cancer3,4 to neurological disorders5, can be traced back to faulty\n\nRNA structure, function, or posttranscriptional regulation. Signaling hubs inside cells can\n\nalso be regulated by RNA molecules, further suggesting more dynamic processes can utilize\n\nRNA-centered signaling to control specific outputs to regulate cell fate and disease onset6.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
