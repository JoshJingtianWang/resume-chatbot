Western blot detection of HELLS confirms loss of HELLS protein\n\nin Rb1/p107/Hells TKO tumors and HELLS expression in Rb1/p107 DKO tumors. Tubulin\n\nused as a loading control. D. Principal components analysis (PCA) (3D loading plot) of RNA-\n\nseq data from three Rb/p107 DKO and three Rb1/p107/Hells TKO tumors show the absence\n\nof distinct transcriptome clusters.\n\nHells loss decreases cellular proliferation in Rb1/p107-deficient retinae\n\nSince Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice develop tumors at a reduced frequency and with\n\nslower progression rates than Rb1/p107 DKO mice, we aimed to identify pathways\n\nregulated by HELLS that aid in the delayed tumor progression. Since transcriptome\n\nanalysis from tumors provided limited insight, we also performed RNA-seq and ATAC-seq\n\nanalyses of P21 retinae from Rb1/p107 DKO and Rb1/p107/Hells mice (n\u2009=\u20093 each) to\n\ndetermine if early transcriptomic differences could deepen our understanding of the\n\nmechanism through which Hells loss contributes to delayed tumorigenesis.\n\nUnlike what we found in tumors, at P21 the transcriptome profile\n\nof Rb1/p107/Hells TKO retinae was markedly distinctive from Rb1/p107 DKO retinae\n\n(Figure 5-5A). None of the 17 genes identified from the tumor DEG analysis\n\n(Supplementary Figure 5-4) were differentially expressed in the same direction in the P21\n\n112\n\nretinae DEG analysis (data not shown). We identified a total of 1455 DEGs, with 434\n\nupregulated genes and 1021 downregulated genes in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO compared\n\nwith Rb1/p107 DKO P21 retinae. Gene ontology (GO) analysis for biological processes of\n\nthe 434 upregulated genes show an enrichment of genes involved in visual system-related\n\nsignaling pathways and functions, as seen by the classification of the top ten most\n\nsignificant GO terms (Figure 5-5B). Among the 1021 downregulated genes, we observed\n\nenrichment of pathways involved in DNA replication and cell division (Figure 5-5C).", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
