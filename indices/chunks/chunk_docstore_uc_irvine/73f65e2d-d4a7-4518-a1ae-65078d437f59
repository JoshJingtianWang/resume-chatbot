Depending on experiment goals, the potential for a less comprehensive\n\ntranscriptome profile generated by EC-tagging should be weighed against the risks of\n\nperturbing gene expression through the use of physical isolation.\n\nRNA-binding proteins have previously been shown to play important roles in md\n\nneuron dendrite arborization4. Given the significance of this class of post-transcriptional\n\nregulators in dendrite arborization, we prioritized the analysis of RBPs from among all the\n\ncandidate regulators of md neuron development identified in this study. Olesnicky et al.\n\n147\n\nused a comprehensive RNAi-based screen to identify a large number of RBPs that affect\n\nclass IV da neuron dendrite morphogenesis. We identified three additional md neuron-\n\nenriched RBPs of interest: ythdc1, hrg and heph. Knockdown of hrg and heph resulted in\n\ndendrite arborization defects while ythdc1 loss of function and knockdown had no effect.\n\nThe lack of a dendrite arborization phenotype in the ythdc1 mutants may indicate this is a\n\nfalse positive (not expressed in md neurons). It is difficult to test this possibility without a\n\nYthdc1 antibody, but the widespread expression of Ythdc1 in CNS neurons14 suggests a\n\ngeneral neural function. An alternative explanation is that Ythdc1 controls splicing of\n\ntranscripts that are irrelevant to dendrite arborization. Drosophila motor neurons that lack\n\nm6A, the RNA modification recognized by Ythdc1, do not have growth or patterning defects\n\nbut do have a moderate increase in the number of synaptic boutons and active zones per\n\nbouton14. Loss of Ythdc1 in md neurons may similarly affect synapses or synaptic activity,\n\nphenotypes that would not be detected in our analysis. The hrg RNAi phenotype may be\n\nexplained by Hrg\u2019s interaction with Orb, an ortholog of human cytoplasmic polyadenylation", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
