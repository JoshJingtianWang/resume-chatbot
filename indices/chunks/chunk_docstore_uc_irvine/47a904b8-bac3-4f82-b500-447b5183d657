It includes three panels labeled (a), (b), and (c).\n\nPanel (a) presents schematics of different versions of ORAI2-GFP constructs labeled from A to G. Each construct is represented with detailed segments including exons, introns, cryptic exons, T2A sequences, and flexible linkers, all color-coded for clarity. The constructs vary in the length and combination of these segments.\n\nPanel (b) displays a bar graph showing the MT-to-WT GFP ratio for the different ORAI2-GFP variants (A through G). The graph indicates the relative GFP expression levels for each variant, with variant C showing the highest ratio, followed by variants D and F.\n\nPanel (c) includes a 3D protein structure visualization on the left and a bar graph on the right. The 3D structure likely represents a protein complex with highlighted regions. The bar graph on the right shows GFP mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) across different SF3B1 plasmid variants: WT, K700E, K666T, and R625G. The R625G variant shows the highest GFP MFI, followed by K666T and K700E, with WT having the lowest.\n\nOverall, the figure presents detailed schematics of ORAI2-GFP constructs, quantitative analysis of their expression, and the impact of different SF3B1 plasmid variants on GFP expression.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-62-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
