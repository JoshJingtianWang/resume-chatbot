Our results show that in the murine retinae, loss of both Rb1 and p107 are\n\nnecessary for the persistent expression of HELLS. These data suggest that the\n\ncompensation by p107 observed in the Rb1 cKO mouse model is sufficient to effectively\n\nrepress Hells expression in the absence of Rb1, an event that likely contributes to the\n\nprevention of tumor formation in Rb1-null mice31. Since HELLS expression levels during the\n\nearly stages of retinal development (E17.5 through P2) in Rb1/p107 DKO retinae are\n\ncomparable with those observed in wild-type retinae, it is likely that the RB family is\n\nrequired for Hells repression during terminal differentiation of one or several retinal cell\n\nfates and failure to do so results in the aiding of tumor progression.\n\nHELLS overexpression is critical for proliferation and retinoblastoma formation in\n\nRb1/p107-null retina\n\nIn this study, we also sought to determine whether HELLS plays a critical role\n\nduring retinoblastoma development. We found that HELLS abrogation during\n\nretinoblastoma development leads to a significant decrease in morbidity and increase in\n\nsurvival. The mechanism(s) by which HELLS contributes to tumorigenesis, however,\n\nremain unknown. One hypothesis is that HELLS overexpression leads to increased de novo\n\nDNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes, thereby decreasing the transcriptional level\n\nof tumor suppressor genes and increasing the incidence of tumor. Given the role of HELLS\n\nin facultative heterochromatin formation, we found it intriguing that we did not observe\n\nsignificant changes in gene transcription in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO tumors compared", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
