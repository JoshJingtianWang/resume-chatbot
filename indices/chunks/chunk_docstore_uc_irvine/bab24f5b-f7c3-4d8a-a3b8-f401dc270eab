In particular, my data\n\nanalysis helped discover a cancer-specific protein defect and this defect was then exploited\n\nto improve the specificity of cancer gene therapies. We hope this work will expand the\n\ncurrent gene therapy toolkit and lay the groundwork for future gene therapies that target\n\nthe biochemical defects in cancers.\n\n7\n\n1.2 References\n\n1.
