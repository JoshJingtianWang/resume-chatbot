It was shown that the ORAI2 splicing\n\ncassette can be minimized from 1076bp to 172bp while still maintaining relatively high\n\n49\n\nmutant-selectivity (Figure 3-2b). Two ORAI2 splicing cassettes in tandem did not offer any\n\nsignificant improvement on the specificity (Figure 3-S1).\n\nThe SF3B1 expression plasmid was mutagenized to two other common SF3B1\n\nmutants in cancers: K666T and R625G15.
