The bars represent the degree of enrichment for each category. Categories and their respective fold enrichment values include:\n- Synaptic growth at NMJ (~5.5)\n- Dorsal closure (~4.5)\n- Peripheral nervous development (~3.5)\n- Cell adhesion (~3)\n- Regulation of cell shape (~2.7)\n- Border follicle cell migration (~2.5)\n- Imaginal disc-wing morphogenesis (~2.3)\n- Cell cortex (~2.2)\n- Nervous system development (~2.1)\n- Microtubule binding (~2)\n- mRNA binding (~1.8)\n- Dendrite morphogenesis (~1.7)\n- DNA binding (~1.5)\n\nThe \"Depleted GO Categories\" chart on the right shows various GO categories along the y-axis, with \"Fold depletion\" values along the x-axis. The bars represent the degree of depletion for each category. Categories and their respective fold depletion values include:\n- Sarcomere organization (~18)\n- Short-term memory (~10)\n- Z disc (~8)\n- Polytene chromosome puff (~6)\n- Actin binding (~5)\n- Microtubule associated complex (~3)\n- Lipid particle (~2.5)\n- Protein binding (~2.3)\n- ATP binding (~2)\n- Plasma membrane (~1.8)\n\nBoth charts include a color gradient indicating p-values, with darker shades representing lower p-values (<10^-7) and lighter shades representing higher p-values (<10^-2). The enriched categories chart has a mix of dark and light bars, whereas the depleted categories chart has mostly darker bars.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-154-28.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
