The hrg RNAi phenotype may be\n\nexplained by Hrg\u2019s interaction with Orb, an ortholog of human cytoplasmic polyadenylation\n\nelement binding protein 1. Hypomorphic alleles of orb cause dendrite arborization defects\n\nin class IV da neurons23, with decreased branching and decreased field size similar to what\n\nwe observed in hrg RNAi neurons. Hrg and Orb may regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation\n\nin md neurons, likely targeting mRNAs encoding regulators of dendrite growth. Heph may\n\naffect dendrite arborization via its repression of oskar (osk) translation. Oskar is necessary\n\nfor proper localization of nanos mRNA in class IV da neurons and osk loss of function\n\ndecreases dendrite branching24, similar to the phenotype we observe in heph RNAi\n\nneurons. Osk mRNA is transported along dendrites24 and Heph likely\n\nrepresses osk translation during transport, as it does in oocytes16. In this\n\n148\n\nmodel, heph knockdown may cause a phenotype similar to osk loss of function due to\n\naltered Osk distribution in dendrites. Confirming these predicted interactions and further\n\ndefining mechanisms by which Hrg and Heph control dendrite arborization will be\n\nimportant areas of future investigation.\n\n6.6 Materials and methods\n\nDrosophila genetics\n\nThe following lines were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center:\n\nOregon-R-P2 (wildtype) (stock # 2376), Gal4477, UAS-mCD8::GFP (stock # 8746), UAS-\n\nythdc1{RNAi} (stock #34627), UAS-hrg{RNAi} (stock # 33378), UAS-heph{RNAi} (stock #\n\n55655). For EC-tagging, Gal4109(2)80 (stock # 8769) was combined with UAS-CD:UPRT on the\n\n3rd chromosome (stock # 77120) to make the stable line Gal4109(2)80; UAS-CD:UPRT. The\n\nythdc1 loss of function mutant, YT521-NP2]/ TM6C -1, was provided by Dr. Eric Lai.\n\nEC-tagging, RNA purification and sequencing library preparation\n\n5-ethynylcytosine was synthesized as previously described8.
