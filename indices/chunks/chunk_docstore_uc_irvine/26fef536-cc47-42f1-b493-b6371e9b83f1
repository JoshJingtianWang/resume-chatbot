Lastly, we identified a class of PTMs on RBPs were not associated\n\nwith enzymes in protein\u2013protein interaction databases (\u2018M\u2019; Figure 2-3A); however, for\n\nsome, this can be attributed to their nature of deposition. For example, both \u2018sulfenic acid\u2019\n\n24\n\nand \u2018oxidation\u2019 refer to oxidized forms of cysteine that are due to changes in the oxidation\n\nstate of cells and do not require enzyme deposition54,56.\n\nOur approach identified tens of thousands of potentially modifying interactions, or\n\ncases in which a modified RBP interacts with an enzyme capable of making the same\n\nmodification. Most modified proteins had at least one potentially modifying interaction;\n\nhowever, the percentage of proteins with such an interaction varied by PTM type (Figure 2-\n\n3B). For the four most common modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitination,\n\nacetylation, and methylation), over 80% of modified RBPs have evidence for a protein\u2013\n\nprotein interaction that could control PTM stoichiometry, including >113 000\n\nphosphorylation events. Others, like hydroxylation (29%) and succinylation (13%), had far\n\nfewer explanatory interactions. This may be due to a bias in the study of particular\n\nmodifications, as kinase, methylation and acetylation signaling are well-studied for their\n\ndiverse roles in regulating protein function. For many of the modifications, analysis of\n\nprotein\u2013protein interactions revealed potential enzymes that are controlling deposition. As\n\nshown in (Figure 2-3C), nearly all RBPs that have observed phosphorylations have\n\nassociated enzymes that interact.\n\nThe large landscape of identified RBP-PTMs in which a potential enzyme pair was\n\nidentified through analysis of protein\u2013protein interactions implored us to look deeper at", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
