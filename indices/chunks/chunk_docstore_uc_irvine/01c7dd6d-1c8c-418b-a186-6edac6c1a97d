The schematic diagram details the structure of three variants of the ORAI2-GFP plasmid (labeled B, H, and I) co-transfected with either wild-type (WT) or mutant (MT) SF3B1 plasmids in HEK cells. \n\nIn the diagram, exons are represented in blue, introns in gray, cryptic exons in orange, T2A sequences in pink, and flexible linkers in black. The different variants show various configurations and insertions of these elements, resulting in different structural layouts for each plasmid variant.\n\nTo the right of the schematic, a bar graph illustrates the MT-to-WT GFP ratio for each of the three ORAI2-GFP variants (B, H, and I). The graph depicts that variant H has the highest MT-to-WT GFP ratio, followed by variant B, and then variant I, which has the lowest ratio. Error bars indicate the variability or standard deviation of the data. This suggests that the expression or function of the GFP-tagged ORAI2 variants differs depending on whether they are associated with the wild-type or mutant SF3B1 plasmids.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-73-12.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
