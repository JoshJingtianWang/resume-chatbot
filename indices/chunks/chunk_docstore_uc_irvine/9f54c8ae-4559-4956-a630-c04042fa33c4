PTM marks are dynamic and can either be deposited through enzyme-regulated\n\nprocesses or changes in cellular chemistry (i.e. oxidation). While PTMs have been studied\n\nfor quite some time through the lens of protein regulation, our understanding and\n\ncharacterization of RBP PTMs is quite limited with only a few examples well characterized\n\nto date.\n\nThere has been some important headway in characterizing PTM modifications and\n\ntheir role in regulating RNA binding proteins. The limited cases illustrate just how\n\n14\n\nimpactful changes to the chemical composition of RBPs can be17. For example, in the\n\ninterferon (IFN)-\u03b3-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) system18,19, IFN-\u03b3 induces\n\nformation of a multiprotein GAIT complex that binds structural GAIT elements in the 3'\n\nuntranslated regions (UTR) of multiple inflammation-related mRNAs. This complex is\n\nrecruited and regulated by IFN-\u03b3-induced kinases that phosphorylate RNA binding proteins\n\nto control mRNA translation; PTM regulation of RBPs in this case are critical for regulating\n\nmRNA interactions and thus the IFN-\u03b3 translation response. In another example, there is\n\ngrowing evidence that PTMs can regulate phase separation20. In the context of tyrosine\n\nphosphorylation, it has been shown that tyrosine residues in RBPs can have weak\n\ninteractions driving phase separation; however, once tyrosine residues are phosphorylated\n\nphase separation breaks down due to coulombic repulsion between the negatively charged\n\nresidues. Overall, such examples highlight the importance of PTM regulation for RBPs, but\n\nlikely represent only a small fraction of the total examples.\n\nExpanding the suite of known and addressable of PTMs on RBPs requires rigorous\n\ncuration and interrogation of existing proteome-scale mass spectrometry data coupled to\n\nother facets of RNA\u2013protein interaction biology; together this could serve as a platform for\n\nnovel hypotheses related to functional types and sites of PTMs on RBPs.
