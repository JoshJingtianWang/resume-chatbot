The TATA boxes are derived from various promoters (CMV, SV40, TK, and a synthetic YB-TATA), and the constructs are designed to assess the impact of replacing the TATA box on gene expression.\n\n2. **Figure b**: This panel shows fluorescent images of cells transfected with different TATA box constructs (minYB-TATA, CMV-TATA, SV40-TATA, TK-TATA) at 24 and 48 hours after treatment with 0 and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL Dox. The intensity of fluorescence indicates the level of gene expression driven by each promoter.\n\n3. **Figure c**: This panel shows Western blot results for cells transfected with the same constructs as in panel b, detecting the expression of a His-tagged protein (\u03b1-His) and a control protein (CS). The results are presented for 24 and 48 hours post-Dox treatment.\n\n4. **Figure d**: A graph showing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each construct (minYB-TATA, CMV-TATA, SV40-TATA, TK-TATA) at 48 hours post-Dox treatment, compared to empty plasmid and untransfected controls.\n\n5. **Figure e**: This panel illustrates the design of additional promoter constructs, YB-TATA and SV40-TATA-Long, with differences in the length of the TATA box region.\n\n6. **Figure f**: This panel shows fluorescent images of cells transfected with the YB-TATA and SV40-TATA-Long constructs at 24 and 48 hours after treatment with 0 and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL Dox.\n\n7. **Figure g**: A graph showing the SNR for the YB-TATA and SV40-TATA-Long constructs at 48 hours post-Dox treatment, compared to empty plasmid and untransfected controls.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-90-16.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
