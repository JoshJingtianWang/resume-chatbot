The image is divided into several panels:\n\n**Panel A**: This bar graph shows the count of RBPs with each specific type of PTM. Phosphorylation has the highest count (2208), followed by ubiquitination (1788), and acetylation (1372). Other PTM types include sumoylation, succinylation, and others with varying counts.\n\n**Panel B**: This section features circular inset plots depicting the location and type of PTMs on six example RBPs (EEF2, HNRNPK, TARDBP, CNOT9, DICER1, and FUS). Each PTM type is indicated by a different color, with the PTM type count shown on the right side. These plots illustrate the diversity and distribution of PTMs on these proteins.\n\n**Panel C**: This bar graph illustrates the proportion of modified RBPs that contain multiple PTMs of the same type. Phosphorylation again has the highest percentage (1656), followed by ubiquitination (1416), and acetylation (798).\n\n**Panel D**: This cumulative distribution plot displays the distribution of modified sites per protein for five common PTM types: acetylation, hydroxylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. The x-axis represents the log10 of modification sites, and the y-axis represents the proportion of proteins.\n\n**Panel E**: A box plot comparing the PhastCons score (a measure of evolutionary conservation) for PTM sites versus random sites. The PTM sites show a wider distribution with a median score lower than the random sites, indicating variability in conservation.\n\nTogether, these panels provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence, diversity, and evolutionary conservation of PTMs in RNA binding proteins.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-32-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
