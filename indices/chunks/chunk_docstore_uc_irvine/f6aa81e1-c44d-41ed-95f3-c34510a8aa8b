The PTMs listed on the y-axis include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, and others. The x-axis represents different RBPs, numbered from 1 to 2432. The color-coded legend indicates the state: E (yellow), M (green), and ME (blue).\n\nPanel B is a bar graph illustrating the number of modifying enzyme interactions for different PTMs. Phosphorylation has the highest number of interactions, followed by ubiquitination and acetylation. Other PTMs have significantly fewer interactions.\n\nPanel C shows another bar graph, but this time it depicts the number of proteins with modifying enzyme interactions for each PTM. The trend is similar to panel B, with phosphorylation leading, followed by ubiquitination and acetylation.\n\nPanel D is a line graph displaying the count of RBP interactions for various enzymes, with specific enzymes labeled, such as NTRK1, SRC, AKT1, and PTEN. The graph uses two colors: red for phosphorylation and grey for dephosphorylation.\n\nPanel E contains a Venn diagram comparing the overlap of interactions between two specific enzymes, SRC and PTEN. There are 313 unique interactions for SRC, 197 for PTEN, and 464 shared interactions.\n\nThis image collectively provides a comprehensive visualization of the relationships and interaction frequencies between PTMs and RBPs, with a particular focus on phosphorylation.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-35-4.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
