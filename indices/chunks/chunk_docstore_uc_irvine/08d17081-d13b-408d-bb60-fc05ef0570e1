Lymphoid-specific helicase (HELLS) protein is\n\nan epigenetic modifier directly regulated by the RB/E2F pathway. In this study, we used\n\n97\n\nnovel genetically engineered mouse models to investigate the role of HELLS during retinal\n\ndevelopment and tumorigenesis. Our results indicate that Hells-null retinal progenitor cells\n\ndivide, undergo cell-fate specification, and give rise to fully laminated retinae with minor\n\nbipolar cells defects, but normal retinal function. Despite the apparent nonessential role of\n\nHELLS in retinal development, failure to transcriptionally repress Hells during retinal\n\nterminal differentiation due to retinoblastoma (RB) family loss significantly contributes to\n\nretinal tumorigenesis. Loss of HELLS drastically reduced ectopic division of differentiating\n\ncells in Rb1/p107-null retinae, significantly decreased the incidence of retinoblastoma,\n\ndelayed tumor progression, and increased overall survival. Despite its role in\n\nheterochromatin formation, we found no evidence that Hells loss directly affected\n\nchromatin accessibility in the retina but functioned as transcriptional co-activator of E2F3,\n\ndecreasing expression of cell cycle genes. We propose that HELLS is a critical downstream\n\nmediator of E2F-dependent ectopic proliferation in RB-null retinae. Together with the\n\nnontoxic effect of HELLS loss in the developing retina, our results suggest that HELLS and\n\nits downstream pathways could serve as potential therapeutic targets for retinoblastoma.\n\n5.3 Introduction\n\nThe RB pathway can directly regulate genes that control cell cycle exit but can also\n\nregulate the expression of genes that control cell-fate specification and differentiation\n\nthrough mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling and epigenetic control1. In the\n\ndeveloping retina, the RB pathway is critical in development and tumorigenesis. Genetic", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
