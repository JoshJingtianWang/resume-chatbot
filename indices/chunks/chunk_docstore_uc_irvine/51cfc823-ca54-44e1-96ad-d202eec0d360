Focusing on phosphorylation, an analysis of overlapping protein\u2013protein\n\ninteractions suggests master regulators that could be controlling PTM deposition and\n\nremoval. This analysis highlights the potential of such enzymes, which have known roles in\n\nregulating cancer phenotypes, at center stage, thus likely controlling signaling through RBP\n\nfunction. Two enzymes highlighted, PTEN and SRC kinase, are known to be critically\n\nimportant in controlling oncogenic phenotypes, but there has yet to be a connection in their\n\n34\n\nrole as master regulators of RBP function and as such the potential for re-wiring the\n\ntranscriptome. Our database provides a framework for generating hypotheses about\n\npotential communication between PTM regulation and RBP function ripe for testing.\n\nWe also analyzed the relationship between PTM deposition sites and mutations\n\nidentified in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our analysis revealed that many of the catalogued\n\nRBPs contain mutations, with some familiar nucleic acid binding proteins such as p53\n\ndominating the landscape, but further analysis revealed lesser-known yet likely important\n\nmutations. For example, the SF3B1 gene encodes part of the U2 snRNP portion of the\n\nspliceosome B complex. Consistent with the literature, we observe that SF3B1 is enriched\n\nin mutations; one in particular, K700E, is now established to play an important role in\n\nregulating alternative splicing through an unknown mechanism67. Our PTM atlas may\n\nprovide a clue by virtue of the complementary analysis of PTM mass spectrometry and\n\nstructural datasets demonstrating that K700 is a site of ubiquitination which may interact\n\nwith the pre-mRNA undergoing splicing. A complete mechanism, further analyzed through\n\nthe lens of controlling ubiquitin deposition, is sure to provide additional understanding of\n\nthis modified enriched mutation site.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
