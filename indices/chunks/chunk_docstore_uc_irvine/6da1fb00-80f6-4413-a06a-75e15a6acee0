Furthermore, TCPs often require enhancers,\n\nintrons and other elements to sustain expression at therapeutic levels12. Hybrid promoters\n\nhave been used to achieve both the specificity and expression level, but they further\n\nincrease the complexity and size of the cargo13.\n\nTargeting ligands have been coupled to or genetically incorporated to the vector\n\ncapsid to improve the specificity of the gene therapy14. However, this specificity is reliant\n\non the expression of surface receptors on the cancer cells. Current cancer-targeted\n\ntherapeutic approaches rely on the identity of cell-type specific surface markers that enable\n\nselective drug delivery, but many of these receptors are also expressed on the surfaces of\n\nnormal and germ cells15. Intracellular metabolic and gene expression profiles in cancer\n\ncells are instead drastically different from normal cells16. Moreover, cancer stem cell\n\nsurface markers are also found on normal stem cells17.\n\nCytotoxic proteins for cancer therapies\n\n2\n\nProteins are highly modular and flexible macromolecules, allowing then to be\n\nsynthetically engineered to achieve diverse functionalities or be combined with other\n\nprotein species based on clinical needs18. Many proteins exhibiting cytotoxicity have been\n\nused in recent years as anticancer drugs. Toxins from scorpions, plants and bacteria have\n\nbeen rich sources of protein-based anticancer drugs19\u201321. For example, The Kid (for killing\n\ndeterminant) toxin is an RNase found in gram negative bacteria, capable of cleaving mRNAs\n\nat 5\u2032-UUACU-3\u2032 sites22. It has been found that Kid toxin induces cell death in eukaryotic\n\ncells23. Interestingly, Kid has an antidote protein, Kis (for killing suppressor), that\n\nneutralizes the RNase activity of Kid.
