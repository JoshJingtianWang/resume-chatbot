The most mutation-rich cancer type was endometrioid carcinomas, which are known\n\nto be very unstable and as such much richer in mutations overall63.\n\nAnalysis of the sites of mutations along RNA binding proteins provided greater\n\nunderstanding of which proteins are more enriched in mutations and how diverse the\n\nmutation sites are. As illustrated in Figure 2-4C, the most frequently observed PTM-linked\n\nmutation was at methylated position 213 in TP53, the well-known and frequently-mutated\n\ntumor suppressor. This mutation was observed in multiple patients with several cancer\n\ntypes, including colon, skin, breast, stomach, and uterine cancers. Consistent with p53\u2019s\n\nknown role as the \u2018guardian of the genome\u2019, its high mutation rate is associated with many\n\ncancer types63.\n\n28\n\nOne of the most common PTM-linked mutations outside of TP53 was a mutation\n\nfrom lysine to glutamic acid at position 700 in SF3B1 (Figure 2-4C). This mutation is\n\nobserved in multiple patients with breast carcinoma (0.9% frequency) and thymoma (1.6%\n\nfrequency), as well as single patients with prostate adenocarcinoma, cutaneous melanoma,\n\nsarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. This lysine is shown to be ubiquitinated in our\n\nanalysis of PTM sites. Plotting all the PTM sites and mutational frequencies across SF3B1\n\ndemonstrate that the K700E site is by far the most frequently mutated (Figure 2-4D).\n\nSF3B1 is involved in splicing and is the most frequently mutated splicing factor in cancer,\n\nand mutation at this position is linked to loss of splicing function64. As such, it seems that\n\nthe altered K700E ubiquitin site is likely altering ubiquitin deposition and splicing.
