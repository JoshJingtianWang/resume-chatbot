Only experimentally determined PTMs\n\nwere used; computational predictions were excluded. Additional PTM datasets not present\n\nin these databases were identified via literature search (Supplementary Table 2-S1). All\n\nprotein identifiers were converted to UniProt identifiers, and proteins present in\n\nSwissProt31 were retained for analysis.\n\nA list of RNA-binding proteins was derived from three publications containing\n\nextensive lists of experimentally-determined RBPs9,10,34,35.\n\n16\n\nProtein-protein interactions were collected from 8 publicly available databases:\n\nBIOGRID, CORUM, DIP, ELM, hu.MAP, IntAct, MINT and STRING36\u201343.\n\nPTM site conservation analysis\n\nPhastCons conservation scores for a multiple alignment of 99 vertebrate genomes to\n\nthe human genome (phastCons100way) were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser\n\n[citation]. For each RNA binding protein, phastCons scores from 100 random positions\n\nwere selected from its exons for background in comparison to scores at PTM positions.\n\neCLIP mRNA binding data\n\neCLIP narrowPeak files from 92 RNA-binding proteins in K562 cells was\n\ndownloaded from the ENCODE website (https://www.encodeproject.org/). eCLIP peak\n\nregions overlapping genes were identified using44 bedtools to intersect eCLIP peaks with\n\nGRCh38 Gencode v24 annotations. Hits where at 50% of the peak overlaps the gene on the\n\ncorrect strand in both eCLIP replicates were considered instances of the RBP binding that\n\ngene.\n\nCancer mutation data\n\nPosition, consequence, distribution, and frequency data were obtained for each\n\nmutation identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas and cross-referenced with identified PTM\n\npositions.\n\nUV mass spec sites\n\nRNA\u2013protein crosslink data was retrieved from four publications45\u201348 . As these\n\nstudies employed varying techniques with differing resolutions, we adjusted all crosslink\n\ndata to a 21-position range centered on the reported crosslink range.
