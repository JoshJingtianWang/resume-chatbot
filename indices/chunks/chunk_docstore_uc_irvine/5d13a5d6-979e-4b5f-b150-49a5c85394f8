After incubation for 30\u2009min with secondary antibodies, the\n\nmembranes were again rinsed three times with TBS-T for 5\u2009min per wash. Bands were\n\nvisualized using chemiluminescence (SuperSignal\u2122 West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate\n\nby Thermo Scientific). Band intensity assessed using Image J software.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nRetinae were isolated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed overnight in 4%\n\n(w/v) paraformaldehyde. Whole retinae were embedded in 4% (w/v) agarose in PBS. The\n\nretinae were then cut into 50-\u03bcm slices using a vibratome. Retinal sections were blocked in\n\n5% (v/v) normal donkey, goat, or rabbit serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4\u2009h at room\n\ntemperature and then placed in primary antibody in the same blocking solution at 4\u00b0\n\novernight. Mouse anti-calbindin antibody (C-9848, Sigma) was used at 1:100, rabbit anti-\n\nrecoverin antibody (AB5585, Millipore) was used at 1:5000 dilution, mouse anti-pH3\n\nantibody (H6409, Sigma) was used at 1:200 dilution, mouse anti-syntaxin antibody (S0664,\n\nSigma) was used at 1:500 dilution, mouse anti-glutamine synthetase (610518, BD\n\nBiosciences) was used at 1:100 dilution, rabbit anti-cone-arrestin antibody (AB15282,\n\nMillipore) was used at 1:5000 dilution, and sheep anti-chx10 antibody (X1180P, Exalpha\n\nBiological) was used at 1:200 dilution. The retinal sections were washed three times with\n\nPBS and incubated in corresponding secondary antibody diluted 1:500 in respective\n\nblocking buffer (goat, rabbit, or donkey) for 1\u2009h at room temperature in the dark. Again,\n\nretinae were washed three times with PBS and then incubated in 300\u2009\u03bcl of Vectastain ABC\n\n124\n\nkit (Vector Laboratories) for 30\u2009min at room temperature.
