Hells cKO displayed no major alterations in retinal cell birthing\n\nand cell-fate specification as evidenced by the uniform layer and thickness of the outer\n\nnuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) (Figure 5-\n\n2D; Supplementary Figure 5-1). All cells are located in their corresponding retinal layer.\n\nThe only abnormality observed was found in a subset of bipolar cells (Chx10-\n\nimmunopositive cells). We observed bipolar cellular processes extending through the outer\n\nplexiform layer (OPL) into the ONL. In comparison, the bipolar cell bodies in Cre-negative\n\n105\n\nlittermate controls and in the Cre-negative areas of the same retina are limited to the INL\n\n(Figure 5-2D). No differences in spatial localization were observed for any of the other\n\nretinal cell types analyzed, including pkc-alpha-immunoreactive rod-bipolar cells24 and\n\nrecoverin-immunoreactive photoreceptor cells (Figure 5-2D; Supplementary Figure 5-1).\n\nImmunocytochemical analysis of dissociated retinae was able to detect double-\n\nimmunostained cells for every retinal cell-type-specific antibody and the EGFP reporter of\n\nCre recombination (Figure 5-2E; Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). Quantification of\n\nEGFP\u2009+\u2009and EGFP\u2212 cell types co-stained with retinal cell markers indicated that all cells are\n\npresent in the correct ratios (Figure 5-2F). This confirms that all retinal cell types that are\n\nborn, can terminally differentiate and survive in the absence of HELLS.\n\nIn order to determine if the aberrant bipolar processes observed in Hells cKO mice\n\naffect normal retinal function, we performed electroretinography (ERG) on dark-\n\nadapted Hells cKO mice with retinae that had at least 50% EGFP\u2009+\u2009penetrance compared\n\nwith Cre-negative littermate controls (Figure 5-2G, H). ERG measures the electrical activity\n\nof the various cell types in the retina in response to light stimulation.
