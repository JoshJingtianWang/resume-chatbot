However, uncontrolled delivery of neurotrophic factors led to adverse effects3\u20135.\n\nT-cell immunotherapy for cancer utilized conventional chimeric antigen receptor\n\n(CAR)-expressing T cells has CAR expressed in constitutive mode; consequently, suffer\n\nfrequent on-target and off-tumor toxicity6\u20139. Therefore, to improve safety for this type of\n\ntherapy, it is necessary to tightly regulate CAR expression, restrict antigen recognition and\n\nT-cell activation.\n\nTo address such unmet need for improvement in therapy safety, several inducible\n\nsystems have been developed and modified. One of such is Tet-inducible system including\n\nTet-ON and Tet-OFF versions. Essentially, the Tet-inducible system has a Tet-responsive\n\npromoter (pTet) comprising of 7xTet operon (TetO) sequences, followed by the minimal\n\nCMV immediate early gene without enhancer sequence (miniCMV) and a fusion protein (tTA)\n\nof Tet repressor (TetR) to transcriptional activator VP16 protein from herpex simplex virus\n\n(Tet-OFF)10 or a fusion protein (rtTA, reverse-tTA) of VP16 with TetR variants which\n\nfunctions in reverse mode (Tet-ON)11.
