The results are displayed for four genes: ORAI2, MAP3K7, TTI1, and ZNF91. The bands indicated by arrows suggest the presence of different splice variants in the WT and MT samples.\n\n- **Panel b**: This schematic diagram illustrates the design of a reporter system involving GFP (green fluorescent protein). The diagram shows how GFP can be in-frame or out-of-frame depending on the splicing event, impacting GFP expression.\n\n- **Panel c**: This panel displays fluorescence microscopy images of HEK293T cells showing GFP expression. The images are grouped by gene (ORAI2, MAP3K7, ZNF91) and the type of transfection (WT, MT, None). The presence of green fluorescence indicates successful expression of the GFP-tagged proteins, with variations between WT and MT.\n\n- **Panel d**: This panel presents a Western blot analysis for ORAI2-GFP expression in WT and MT transfected HEK293T cells, along with controls (None, GFP). The GFP and GAPDH (as a loading control) blots show protein expression levels, and the accompanying bar graph quantifies GFP mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for MAP3K7-GFP and ORAI2-GFP plasmids, comparing WT and MT conditions.\n\nOverall, the figure demonstrates the differences in splicing events and resultant protein expressions between WT and MT SF3B1 transfected cells using various analytical techniques.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-60-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
