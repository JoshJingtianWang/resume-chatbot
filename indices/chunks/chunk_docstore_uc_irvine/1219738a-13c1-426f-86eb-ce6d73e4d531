The Kid toxin is a ribonuclease in Escherichia coli\n\nthat preferentially cleaves the RNA at the UUACU of single-stranded regions, while the Kis\n\nantitoxin neutralizes the cell growth inhibition ability of Kid11. In this paper we aim to exploit\n\nthe defective splicing mechanism in mutant SF3B1, and express an in-frame, active Kid toxin\n\nin cancer cells, and an out-of-frame, inactive form of the protein in normal cells. The\n\ndevelopment of such a targeted therapy will serve as a new paradigm for cancer cell death\n\nthat can be extended toward other splicing-defective cancers.\n\n3.4 Results\n\nIdentification of mis-spliced transcripts suitable for mutant selective protein\n\nexpression\n\nZhang et al. first identified introns most mis-spliced at the 3\u2019 ss by mutant SF3B1 via\n\nRNA seq and cloned select mis-spliced targets into minigenes driven by the\n\ncytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter12. Seeing this as an opportunity for a gene therapy, we\n\nrequested the minigene plasmids from them, and first co-transfected the minigene\n\nplasmids with SF3B1 wild type (WT) or K700E mutant (MT) expression plasmids into HEK\n\ncells. After three days post transfection, longer isoforms of the minigene transcripts in MT\n\nsamples were observed via RT-PCR (Figure 3-1a). We were able to recapitulate the mutant\n\ncryptic splicing of the minigenes.\n\nNext, to identify the minigene candidate suitable for protein expression, we cloned\n\nthree of the minigenes (ORAI2, MAP3K7, ZNF91) upstream of GFP (Figure 3-1b). To enable\n\nthe minigene for protein expression, bases were inserted or removed between the cryptic\n\nand the canonical 3\u2019ss to ensure frameshifts. Hidden stop codons in the exons of the\n\n47\n\nminigenes were also removed by point mutagenesis. The mutant-dependent GFP\n\nexpression was validated via flow cytometry and western blotting (Figure 3-1c-d).
