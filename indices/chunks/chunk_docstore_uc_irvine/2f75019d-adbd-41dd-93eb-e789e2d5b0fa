Interestingly, Kid has an antidote protein, Kis (for killing suppressor), that\n\nneutralizes the RNase activity of Kid. In previous studies, the co-expression and\n\nsubsequent silencing of Kis are required for Kid to exhibit its cytotoxicity in eukaryotic\n\ncells23. For the purpose of adeno-associated virus (AAV) packaging for gene therapy\n\ndelivery, the current method to express the Kid toxin is cumbersome and leaves room for\n\nimprovement. In addition, the Diphtheria Toxin segment A (DTA) has been extensively\n\nstudied and used in clinical trials24. It catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of the mammalian\n\nelongation factor EF2, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis. DTA is extremely toxic:\n\nonly one molecule of DTA is sufficient to kill a cell25. Therefore, it is imperative to design a\n\nstringent regulation system to tightly control the expression of DTA.\n\nDeveloping a novel splicing-based cancer gene therapy\n\nTo further improve the safety and effectiveness of cancer gene therapies, we set out\n\nto search for a novel cancer-responsive gene regulatory element. Particularly, we were\n\ninterested in RNA binding proteins (RBPs), as RBPs are constantly in contact with RNA\n\nmolecules during their lifetimes, closely regulating the splicing, transport, expression, and\n\n3\n\nturnover of RNAs26,27. RBPs therefore are a great potential exploit to regulate the transgene\n\nexpression in a gene therapy.\n\nIn our recent bioinformatic analysis on RBPs, we identified SF3B1 (Splicing Factor\n\n3B Subunit 1A) as the most highly mutated residue in RBPs in breast cancer, with ~1% of\n\nthe cancer cases harboring the mutation28. In addition to K700E in breast cancer, we also\n\nreported R625H or R625C in 17.5% of uveal melanoma.\n\nFigure 1-1. Mechanism of action of 3\u2019ss selection by WT or K700E MT SF3B1 A.
