Error bars are standard\n\ndeviation of the mean.\n\nHEK293 cells were transfected with either O-rtTA3 or O-TetR-A mCherry expression\n\nvectors and induced with 0.5\u00b5g/mL Doxycycline (Dox) for 24h and 48h. mCherry expression\n\nsignal was captured using Iive imaging at two different exposure times: 395 miliseconds\n\n(short) and 2 seconds (long). Both the O-rtTA3 and O-TetR-A transfected cells showed robust\n\nred fluorescent signal at 24h and 48h post induction under short exposure. For the\n\ncorresponding un-induced cells, using the short exposure setting we did not see any\n\ndifference between the two systems; however, when the imaging was taken at long exposure\n\ntime, a strikingly intense red fluorescent signal was observed in cells transfected with the O-\n\nrtTA3 but not with O-TetR-A system (Figure 4-1c). To quantify basal expression of the two\n\nsystems, a similar experiment was performed but the cells were subjected to flow cytometry\n\nand the ratio of raw mCherry values of induced to un-induced (SNR) was taken for\n\n71\n\nassessment of the basal expression of the two systems. As shown in Figure 4-1d, by just\n\nincluding a second regulator, TetR, as in the O-TetR-A vector, the SNR is improved by 10 folds\n\ncompared to the classic Tet-ON system.\n\nSynthetic promoter further improves the O-TetR-A basal expression\n\n72\n\nFigure 4-2.
