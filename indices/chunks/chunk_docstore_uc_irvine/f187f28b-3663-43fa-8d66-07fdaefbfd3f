Metazoans lack\n\ncytosine DEminase activity and have varying endogenous uracil phosphoribosyltransferase\n\nactivity, depending on organism or cell type9,10. Only cells expressing CD:UPRT are\n\ncompetent to convert the bioorthogonal base 5-ethynylcytosine (EC) into 5-ethynyluracil\n\n(via CD activity) and subsequently into 5-ethynyluridine monophosphate (via transgenic\n\nUPRT and endogenous pathways) which is ultimately incorporated into nascent RNAs. The\n\n5-ethynyl group allows click-chemistry-based biotinylation of tagged RNAs and subsequent\n\npurification on streptavidin beads. We previously demonstrated the utility of EC-tagging in\n\nthe Drosophila central nervous system (CNS)8. This initial work used a microarray platform\n\nto analyze transcriptomes of relatively large populations of neurons (the entire larval CNS\n\nand the mushroom body neurons). To further test the specificity and sensitivity of this\n\ntechnique and to discover novel regulators of dendrite arborization, here we combine EC-\n\ntagging with RNA-sequencing to generate md neuron transcriptome profiles.\n\n6.4 Results\n\nEC-tagging enriches for larval md neuron-specific transcripts\n\n137\n\nFigure 6-1.
