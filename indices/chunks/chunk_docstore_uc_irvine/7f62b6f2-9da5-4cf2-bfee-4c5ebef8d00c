Traditional cytotoxic\n\nchemotherapy drugs target rapidly dividing cells, killing both cancer cells and certain normal\n\ncells. These drugs lead to side effects and are not effective against quiescent cancer stem\n\ncells. Current targeted cancer therapies largely rely on detecting the extracellular surface\n\nmarkers on cancer cells. However, many of the cancer surface markers can also be found on\n\ngerm cells1. On the other hand, the intracellular environment of cancer cells can be\n\ndrastically different from that of normal cells2. Therefore, if a cancer therapy can detect the\n\nunique intracellular environment and even the cancer-causing mutations of cancer cells, it\n\nwill selectively act upon cancer cells, while leaving normal cells unharmed, thus minimizing\n\nadverse side effects.\n\nAlmost 90% of the human genes undergo some splicing event3. Consequently,\n\nmutations in the splicing machinery can lead to many diseases, including cancer4,5. In our\n\nrecent bioinformatic analysis of RNA binding proteins6, we identified a hotspot mutation in\n\ninvasive breast cancer: K700E in splicing factor 3B 1 (SF3B1). SF3B1 is an essential\n\ncomponent of U2 snRNP, and it directly interacts with both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sides of the branch\n\npoint sequence. In addition to the components within the U2 snRNP, SF3B1 also interacts\n\nwith other proteins in the spliceosome7. Several studies have reported SF3B1 K700E\n\nrecognizes alternative 3\u2019 splice sites (3\u2019ss) upstream of canonical 3\u2019ss8,9. Importantly, Liu and\n\ncolleagues recently demonstrated that SF3B1 K700E mutant suppresses PPP2R5A and\n\nMAP3K7 via aberrant splicing, leading to accelerated cell migration, thus directly linking the\n\n46\n\nSF3B1 K700E mutation to tumorigenesis10.
