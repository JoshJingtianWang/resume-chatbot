In mouse retina, the seven\n\nmajor retinal cell types (rod and cone photoreceptors; horizontal, amacrine, and bipolar\n\ninterneurons; M\u00fcller glia; and ganglion cells) are differentiated from a common population\n\nof multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that appear between embryonic day 11 (E11)\n\n99\n\nand postnatal day 10 (P10) in a conserved temporal order (Figure 5-1A)18,19. The process of\n\nself-renewal and differentiation required for RPCs to differentiate into the distinct neural\n\nlineages is regulated by various molecular mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-\n\ntranscriptional regulation. Epigenetic regulation plays a fundamental role in the\n\nmaintenance of cell identity as well as the stepwise control toward cellular differentiation.\n\nChromatin states of RPCs change gradually during this process and alterations of epigenetic\n\nmarkers during retinal development have been linked to several ocular diseases, including\n\nretinoblastoma6,10,20\u201323. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism and identifying key\n\nchromatin factors that regulate retinal stem cell maintenance and neurogenesis is critical\n\nfor understanding normal retinal development and discovering molecular pathways that\n\ncould be targeted for cancer therapy and intraocular delivery.\n\n100\n\nFigure 5-1.
