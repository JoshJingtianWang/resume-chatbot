The plot reveals that the Rb/p107/Hells group remains tumor-free for a significantly longer period compared to the Rb/p107 group, with a p-value of less than 0.0001 and a hazard ratio (HR) of 10.06.\n\n**Panel B:** This is another Kaplan-Meier survival curve, illustrating the percentage survival over time (in weeks) after tumor detection for the same two groups. The Rb/p107/Hells group shows a significantly improved survival rate compared to the Rb/p107 group, with a p-value of 0.0361.\n\n**Panel C:** This panel shows a Western blot analysis comparing the expression of HELLS and Tubulin proteins between the two groups (Rb1/p107 and Rb1/p107/Hells). The Rb1/p107/Hells group shows a distinct band for HELLS, indicating its expression in this group, while Tubulin serves as a loading control.\n\n**Panel D:** This is a 3D principal component analysis (PCA) plot showing the variance among the data points for the two groups: Rb1/p107 (blue dots) and Rb1/p107/Hells (orange dots). The plot indicates a clear separation between the two groups, with the principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) accounting for 35%, 32%, and 20% of the variance, respectively.\n\nOverall, the image summarizes a study examining the effects of HELLS expression on tumor development and survival, showing significant differences between the Rb/p107 and Rb/p107/Hells groups.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-123-23.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
