The investigator performing ERG measurements was blinded to\n\nthe mouse genotype.\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP assay)\n\n126\n\nChIP assays were performed on Weri retinoblastoma human cell line, postnatal day\n\n0 retinae collected from wild-type mice, or postnatal day 21 retinae collected\n\nfrom Rb1/p107 DKO mice as previously described25. The antibodies used for chromatin\n\npull-down were anti-E2F1 (3742; Cell Signaling) and rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz\n\nBiotechnologies). ChIP DNA was analyzed by qPCR with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) in ABI-7500\n\n(Applied Biosystems). Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 5-1. The primers\n\nflank areas of homology in the mouse and human promoter region locater between\n\nposition \u221294 and 114\u2009bp and \u2212115 and \u2212134 bp, respectively. In human, this sequence falls\n\nwithin a functionally validated E2F1-binding region8. ChIP experiments were run in\n\ntriplicate for each of the three independent retinal samples per condition (n\u2009=\u20093).\n\nRNA sequencing\n\nThe total RNA was isolated using the RNA Micro Kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, 500\u2009ng\n\nof the total RNA was used to create the RNA-seq library following the manufacturer\u2019s\n\nprotocol from purification, mRNA fragmentation through the adenylation of end-repaired\n\ncDNA fragments and cleanup (TruSeq Stranded mRNA, Illumina).

A paired-end 100-bp sequencing run was performed on HiSeq 4000\n\nyielding 348\u2009M PE reads with a final library concentration of 2\u2009nM as determined by qPCR\n\n(KAPA Biosystem).\n\nSequencing reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38, ENSEMBL\n\nv.92) using STAR (v2.5.2a)39.
