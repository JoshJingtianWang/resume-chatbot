It was noticed that a Kid toxin plasmid could not be cloned alone despite using a\n\nmammalian expression promoter. We hypothesize this was because the prokaryotic gene\n\nexpression system allows for the leaky expression of Kid, killing any bacteria carrying the\n\nKid plasmid. Eventually, we were able to clone the Kid plasmid for constitutive mammalian\n\nexpression with the Kis (killing suppressor) antitoxin under a prokaryotic promoter (Figure\n\n3-3a). To test the toxicity of the Kid toxin in mammalian cells, the Kid plasmid (with\n\nmCherry under IRES) was transfected into HEK 293T cells. Three days post transfection,\n\nmicroscopy showed the complete ablation of mCherry by Kid. mCherry expression is\n\nrestored when Kid is co-expressed with Kis (Figure 3-3b).\n\nWe next investigated whether the ORAI2 exons affect the toxicity of Kid. Intron-less\n\nORAI2 was cloned upstream of the Kid toxin. MTT cell viability assay showed that ORAI2\n\nexons negatively affect the toxicity of Kid, however the toxicity is restored with the\n\ninsertion of a T2A self-cleaving peptide between intron-less ORAI2 and Kid (Figure 3-3c).\n\n51\n\nFigure 3-3. Assessment of Kid toxin potency in cell killing. A. Cloning schematics of the\n\nKid toxin for constitutive expression in mammalian cells. In E. coli, the Kis antitoxin is\n\nhighly expressed under the prokaryotic promoter, suppressing any leaked Kid toxin. In\n\nmammalian cells, the mammalian expression machinery would only recognize the\n\neukaryotic promoter, leading to high toxicity in cells. B.
