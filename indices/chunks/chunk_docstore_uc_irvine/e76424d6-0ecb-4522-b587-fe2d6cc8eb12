The constructs compared are ORAI2-T2A-PUMA WT, ORAI2-T2A-PUMA MT, K WT, and K MT.\n\n- The vertical axis represents MTT optical density, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.\n- The horizontal axis represents the days of observation (Day 1 to Day 4).\n- Four different colored bars represent each construct:\n  - Purple for ORAI2-T2A-PUMA WT\n  - Light purple for ORAI2-T2A-PUMA MT\n  - Green for K WT\n  - Light green for K MT\n\nOn Day 1, ORAI2-T2A-PUMA WT has the highest MTT optical density, followed by K WT, indicating higher cell viability. By Day 2, a noticeable decrease in MTT optical density is observed for all constructs, with ORAI2-T2A-PUMA WT still maintaining higher optical density compared to others. This trend continues through Day 3 and Day 4, where ORAI2-T2A-PUMA WT consistently shows higher optical density, suggesting lower cell killing potency compared to the other constructs. K WT also shows relatively higher optical density compared to K MT. Overall, the data indicates varying cell killing potency among the different constructs over time.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-74-13.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
