The diagram shows two different promoter regions: miniCMV (in orange) and Long-YB-TATA (in blue). Both constructs also include the Kozak ATG sequence, which is essential for initiating translation. The red arrow and text indicate that the miniCMV promoter was replaced with the YB-TATA promoter in one of the constructs.\n\nPanel (b) presents a scatter plot comparing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the two promoters (miniCMV and Long-YB-TATA) across two conditions: O-rtTA3 and O-TetR-A. Data points for miniCMV are represented in orange, while data points for Long-YB-TATA are represented in blue. The plot shows that Long-YB-TATA has a higher SNR compared to miniCMV in both conditions, indicating that Long-YB-TATA might be a more effective promoter.\n\nPanel (c) shows Western blot results for protein expression under different conditions. The top part of the panel displays protein bands detected using an anti-His antibody (\u03b1-His), indicating the presence of tagged proteins. The bottom part of the panel shows a Coomassie stain (CS) of the gel, serving as a loading control to ensure equal protein loading across the samples. The conditions tested include both miniCMV and Long-YB-TATA promoters in the presence (0.5 \u00b5g/mL) and absence (0 \u00b5g/mL) of doxycycline (Dox). The results suggest that protein expression is higher with the Long-YB-TATA promoter in the presence of doxycycline.\n\nOverall, the image shows an experimental comparison of gene expression efficiency between two promoters, with data suggesting that Long-YB-TATA may drive stronger gene expression than miniCMV.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-84-15.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
