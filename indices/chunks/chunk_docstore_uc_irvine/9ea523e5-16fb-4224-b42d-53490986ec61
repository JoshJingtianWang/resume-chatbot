D. Genome-wide heatmap plot of chromatin accessibility peaks (ATAC-seq) from\n\nflow-sorted EGFP-negative Cre-negative Rb1/p107/Hells and EGFP-positive Rb1/p107 DKO\n\nand Rb1/p107/Hells TKO P21 retina grouped by mean reads and by distance from the\n\ntranscription starting site (TSS). Each row represents a gene ordered in descending\n\naccessibility mean reads. E. Heatmap of all differentially expressed genes GO clustered as\n\nG1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle in P21 retinae from Rb/p107 DKO compared\n\nwith Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice. Highlighted in red are known genes transcriptionally co-\n\nactivated by HELLS. F. Real-time RT-qPCR validation of some of the RNA-seq\n\ndownregulated genes involved in cell cycle progression. n\u2009=\u20093; *p\u2009<\u20090.05 by\n\nunpaired t test. G. Representative images of P21 retina cross-sections from Rb1/p107 DKO\n\nand Rb1/p107/Hells TKO Z/EG mice labeled with Click-iT EdU (proliferating cells; red).\n\nNuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). EGFP fluorescence by the Z/EG reporter\n\ntransgene captured areas of Chx10-Cre-mediated EGFP expression (green). Images taken on\n\n\u00d720 power field. Scale bar\u2009=\u200950\u2009\u03bcm. H. Quantification of the proportion of EdU-positive cells\n\nfrom dissociated retinae from Rb1/p107 DKO and Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice from\n\nindependent litters (n\u2009=\u20093). Each bar represents the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of 2000 cells scored from\n\neach retina. **p\u2009<\u20090.0021 by unpaired t test.\n\nPrevious in vitro studies have described HELLS as a transcriptional co-activator of\n\ncell proliferation, binding directly to the promoter regions of cell cycling genes, including\n\n115\n\nCDC6, MKi67, PCNA, CCNB1, MCM4, E2F1, and CCNA226,27. Our RNA-seq analysis detected\n\nsignificant downregulation in all these cell cycle genes.
