The presence of doxycycline appears to enhance gene expression in some constructs, particularly the minYB-TATA and YB-TATA constructs.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-90-16.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
