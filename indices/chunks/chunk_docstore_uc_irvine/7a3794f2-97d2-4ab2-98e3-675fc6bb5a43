Identification of md neuron enriched and depleted transcripts.\" The plot is used to visualize differential gene expression data. The x-axis represents the Log2 Fold Change, which shows the magnitude of change in gene expression, while the y-axis represents the -log10(padj), which indicates the statistical significance of the changes in gene expression.\n\nThe data points are colored either gray or red. Gray points represent genes that are not statistically significant (NS), while red points represent genes with an adjusted p-value (padj) less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance.\n\nSeveral genes are labeled on the plot. On the left side (negative Log2 Fold Change), genes such as \"mbl,\" \"nrm,\" \"bt,\" \"Zasp52,\" \"Mhc,\" \"sls,\" \"how,\" and \"Mhcl\" are identified, suggesting these genes are depleted in md neurons. On the right side (positive Log2 Fold Change), genes like \"fray,\" \"Lar,\" \"Caper,\" \"elav,\" \"Patronin,\" \"Lis1,\" \"Cirl,\" and \"Ect4\" are labeled, indicating these genes are enriched in md neurons.\n\nThe plot shows a clear separation between enriched and depleted transcripts, highlighting specific genes that are either overexpressed or underexpressed in the md neurons.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-150-26.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
