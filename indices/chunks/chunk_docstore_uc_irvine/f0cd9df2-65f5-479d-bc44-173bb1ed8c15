Slides were washed three times with PBS, and\n\nincubated in 300\u2009\u03bcl of Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) for 30\u2009min at room\n\n125\n\ntemperature. Slides were washed three times in PBS and incubated with tyramide Cy3\n\n1:150 in amplification buffer (Perkin Elmer) for 10\u2009min. After washing with PBS three\n\ntimes, DAPI was added (1:1000 dilution in PBS) for 5\u2009min to stain the nuclei. Slides were\n\nwashed twice with PBS and mounted using gelvatol containing DABCO. Imaging was\n\ncompleted using Life Technologies EVOS microscope. Cell scoring was performed by a\n\nblinded investigator.\n\nElectroretinography (ERG)\n\nFor scotopic ERG measurement, mice were dark adapted for 24\u2009h prior to ERG\n\nrecording. Each group consisted of four 5-week-old mice. Under dim red light, mice were\n\nanesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail consisting of 20\u2009mg/ml ketamine and\n\n5\u2009mg/ml xylazine in phosphate-buffered saline at a dose of 0.1\u2009ml per 20\u2009g body weight.\n\nPupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide (Henry Schein, Melville, NY), and applied with\n\n2.5% hypromellose (Akorn, Lake Forest, IL) to keep corneas hydrated. Contact electrodes\n\nwere placed on corneas while the reference electrode needle was positioned subdermally\n\nbetween the ears. The a-wave and b-wave responses were recorded followed by a white\n\nlight stimulus of different flash intensities (\u22123.3 to 1.7\u2009log\u2009cd\u00b7s/m2). For each intensity, 3\u201320\n\nrecordings were made with the resting intervals for recovery from photobleaching and\n\nwere averaged for the final amplitude. All ERGs were recorded with the Celeris ophthalmic\n\nelectrophysiology system (Diagnosys LLC, Lowell, MA) and analyzed with Espion V6\n\nsoftware (Diagnosys LLC). Statistical analysis was performed with paired t test. Data are\n\nrepresented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. The investigator performing ERG measurements was blinded to\n\nthe mouse genotype.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
