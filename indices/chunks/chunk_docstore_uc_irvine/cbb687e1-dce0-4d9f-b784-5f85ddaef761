We estimate there are 484 md neurons per larva\n\n(22 md neurons per hemisegment20) compared to tens of thousands of cells in the larval\n\ncarcass. Through the use of EUd-tagged and mock-tagged references, we obtained\n\nsignificant enrichment of expected md sensory neuron transcripts and a list of potential\n\nnovel regulators of md neuron development and function.\n\n146\n\nNeuronal metabolic RNA labeling experiments have revealed that profiling newly\n\ntranscribed mRNAs can reveal gene expression dynamics that are missed by more\n\ntraditional steady-state measurements21,22. Analysis of mRNAs synthesized over a\n\nrelatively short period likely aided our detection of transcripts that have a high rate of\n\ndecay, such as transcription factors, signaling factors, and RNA binding proteins (classes of\n\ngenes we have shown to encode low stability mRNAs13). For example, in the embryonic\n\nnervous system, mRNAs encoding the three RBPs we selected for analysis (ythdc1, heph,\n\nand hrg) all have below average half-lives13. As previously described7, metabolic RNA\n\ntagging approaches are most effective when comparing purified target cell RNA to a\n\nreference generated by metabolic tagging in all cell types of the starting material (tissue or\n\nwhole animal). For this reason, any genes transcribed in more abundant cells of the carcass\n\nare unlikely to be identified as md neuron-enriched in this study. For example, Iyer et al.\n\nidentified the transcription factors Poxm and Hand as transcribed in da neurons but these\n\ngenes are also transcribed in larval muscle and are abundant in our EUd ref-RNA. EC-\n\ntagging may be best suited for the discovery of differentially transcribed genes while\n\nphysical isolation methods such as FACS are better suited for defining complete\n\ntranscriptomes.
