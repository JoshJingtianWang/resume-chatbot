Heatmap of interaction types for each RBP and PTM type. \u2018ME\u2019 indicates that\n\nthe RBP contains the indicated PTM and also interacts with an enzyme known to regulate\n\nthat modification. \u2018M\u2019 indicates a protein that contains the PTM, but is not known to\n\ninteract with an enzyme which regulates it. \u2018E\u2019 indicated proteins that interact with\n\n23\n\nenzymes which regulate the PTM, but do not contain that PTM. B. Total count of potentially\n\nmodifying interactions per PTM type. Each enzyme interacting with a modified protein is\n\ncounted as a separate interaction. C. Count of RBPs with modifying interactions for each\n\nPTM type. Gray bars represent the total number of PTMs with the given modification. D.\n\nNumber of RBPs which interact with each phosphorylating or dephosphorylating enzyme.\n\nE. Number of RBPs with interact with the kinase SRC and/or dephosphorylase PTEN.\n\nPTM modifications on proteins are deposited, read and removed by distinct classes\n\nof enzymes that ultimately control PTM stoichiometry53,54. To identify the specific enzymes\n\nwith may be responsible for depositing each PTM, we cross-referenced our list of RBPs\n\nwith 8 protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) databases 36\u201343. We then identified enzymes of the\n\nappropriate class which interact with RBPs carrying the corresponding PTM (from our\n\nanalysis above). RBPs with known PTMs that require protein enzymes for deposition or\n\nremoval, and which are known to interact with enzymes that carry out these functions, are\n\ncommonly identified in these data (\u2018ME\u2019; Figure 2-3A; Supplementary Figure 2-S1). In\n\naddition, specific RBPs were cataloged to interact with PTM-depositing enzymatic proteins\n\n(\u2018E\u2019; Figure 2-3A), but we did not observe these PTMs in our catalog. This may be due in\n\npart to degradation of proteins bearing certain modifications, including proteolytic\n\ncleavage and sumoylation, making these less likely to be profiled by large-scale PTM", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
