Quantification of induced mCherry signal from\n\ndifferent O-TetR-A vectors and controls plasmid at different Dox concentrations. MFI: mean\n\nfluorescent intensity, Flow replicates: n = 3. Error bars are standard deviation of the mean.\n\nSimilar to Long-SV40-TATA, Long-YB-TATA vector requires the same working\n\nconcentration of Dox, ranging from at least 0.063 - 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, to induce mCherry expression\n\nabove noise level. In comparison to Long-SV40-TATA under un-induced condition, mCherry\n\nexpression from Long-YB-TATA vector was five times greater, indicating a higher basal\n\nexpression of Long-YB-TATA vector (Figure 4-4a, b). As previously shown in Figure 4-2c,\n\nLong-YB-TATA already outperforms both the miniCMV-containing O-TetR-A and the classic\n\nTet-ON O-rtTA3 vectors, yet its performance is still suboptimal when comparing to Long-\n\nSV40-TATA vector. The result shown here is consistent with previous data from Long-YB-\n\nTATA vector (Figure 4-3g). In short, we have established a range of Dox working\n\nconcentrations for the O-TetR-A system that is lower than the currently recommended", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
