Modified positions are colored according to PTM type.\n\n30\n\nWe first calculated the frequency of intersection between PTM sites and RBP\u2013RNA\n\ncrosslink peptides. In this scenario, peptides crosslinking to RNA in cells would also have\n\nPTM sites within their peptide range. In most cases PTM sites did not overlap with\n\ncrosslink sites, but in rare instances proteins had a substantial amount of PTM sites that\n\ncorresponded to crosslink peptide sequences (Figure 2-5C)45\u201348. Using this data, we worked\n\nto understand the primary sequence resolution of the interactions and PTM sites, counting\n\nthe number of PTMs that clustered near the crosslink peptide sites. CLIP crosslinking\n\nprotocols rely on reactivity of nucleic acids and residues to form UV crosslinks; however,\n\nnot all are equally reactive69. Specific residues including lys, cys, tyr, phe and trp are more\n\nreactive for UV crosslinking, and are also subject to posttranslational modification. In cases\n\nwhere the reactive residue is modified, the modification could potentially interfere with the\n\ncrosslinking reaction. To avoid this potential source of bias, we additionally examined\n\nPTMs up to 10 positions away from a crosslink site. As shown in Figure 5b, some PTMs had\n\nobserved depositions near the center of the crosslink site, suggesting that they may be near\n\nthe RNA interface of RNA binding proteins. Across all PTMs, there is an inverse relationship\n\nbetween distance from the nearest crosslink site and PTM frequency (Spearman's rho = \u2013\n\n0.84, P < 2e\u201316). For individual PTMs, each had a negative association between frequency\n\nand distance from crosslink site, which was significant for 16/33 PTMs (Supplementary\n\nTable 2-S4). The strongest association was observed for phosphorylation (rho = \u20130.83),\n\nfollowed by acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation (rho = \u20130.65, \u20130.64 and \u20130.62\n\nrespectively). This observation is very exciting as the accounts of direct competition", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
