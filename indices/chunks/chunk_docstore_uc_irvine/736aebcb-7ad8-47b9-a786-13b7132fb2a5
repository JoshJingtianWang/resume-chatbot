A portion of the ORAI2 gene was chosen and modified to be the splicing RNA\n\nswitch of the system. The Kid RNase was used as the toxin of choice and its cloning and\n\ntoxicity were optimized. The leakiness of the design in WT cells was lessened by the addition\n\nof the antitoxin. Moreover, we have shown that ORAI2 has the potential to be engineered to\n\nfacilitate the gene therapy design. It can be used to target mutations other than SF3B1 K700E\n\nand can regulate the expression of a variety of protein cargos such as bacterial toxins and\n\npro-apoptotic factors. Lastly, we have shown the potential of expanding the use case of our\n\ngene therapy by exploiting other alternative splicing events. However, the mechanism of\n\naction of the mis-splicing of those expanded events are unknown.\n\n57\n\nRecently, North et al. reported a similar design to selectively express the herpes\n\nsimplex virus\u2013thymidine kinase (HSV\u2013TK) in SF3B1 mutant cancer cells27. Compared to our\n\ndesign, their design involved inserting a \u201cmutant-splice-out\u201d intron that was spliced out in\n\nSF3B1-mutant cancer cells, but spliced in in WT cells, thus disrupting the translation of the\n\ntoxic protein. Their design requires a deliberate choice of the insertion location of the\n\nsynthetic intron, as the ORF of the cargo is involved in the alternative splicing. In our design,\n\nthe synthetic intron is inserted upstream of the cargo ORF. The splicing of the synthetic\n\nintron is not affected by the ORF of the toxin. This enables easy swapping the cargo and better\n\ngeneralizability of the design.\n\n3.6 Methods\n\nExpression Plasmid Constructs\n\nThe SF3B1 WT and K700E MT plasmids were obtained from addgene (#82576 and\n\n#82577). The SF3B1 K666T and R625G plasmids were made by point mutagenesis based\n\non the WT plasmid. The ORAI2, MAP3K7, ZNF91 minigene plasmids were gifts from Dr.\n\nJames Manley\u2019s lab 12.
