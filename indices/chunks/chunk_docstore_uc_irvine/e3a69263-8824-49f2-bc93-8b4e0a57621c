Here's a detailed summary:\n\n1. **Panel A**: This schematic illustrates the structure and genetic manipulation of the HELLS floxed allele. The diagram shows the insertion of FRT and loxP sites, allowing for the conditional deletion of the HELLS gene through the expression of Flp and Cre recombinases.\n\n2. **Panel B**: A Western blot analysis comparing HELLS protein levels in control and HELLS conditional knockout (cKO) samples. The bands indicate that HELLS protein is reduced in the cKO sample, as quantified by \u03b2-ACTIN as a loading control (1.0 in control vs. 0.5 in HELLS cKO).\n\n3. **Panel C**: A bar graph showing relative mRNA levels of various genes (Arr3, Calb1, Chx10, Crx, GS, Hes1, Lhx1, Nr2e3, Pax6, Prkca, Prox1, Rcvrn, Rho) in control and HELLS cKO samples. There appear to be no significant differences in mRNA levels between the two groups for these genes.\n\n4. **Panel D**: Immunohistochemistry images showing the localization of different proteins (chx10, pkc-alpha, recoverin) in retinal sections from control and HELLS cKO mice. The images are stained with DAPI to visualize cell nuclei and Cre recombinase to identify cells where Cre is expressed. The retinal layers are labeled as ONL (outer nuclear layer), INL (inner nuclear layer), IPL (inner plexiform layer), and GCL (ganglion cell layer).\n\n5. **Panel E**: Immunofluorescence images of various retinal cells stained for different markers (recoverin, cone arrestin, calbindin, chx10, pkc-alpha) alongside Cre and DAPI. These images show the specific localization of these markers in different retinal cell types.\n\n6. **Panel F**: A bar graph showing the percentage of cells positive for various markers (recoverin, cone arrestin, calbindin, chx10, pkc-alpha, GS, syntaxin) in EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative cells. The data suggests similar proportions of marker-positive cells in both groups.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-115-21.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
