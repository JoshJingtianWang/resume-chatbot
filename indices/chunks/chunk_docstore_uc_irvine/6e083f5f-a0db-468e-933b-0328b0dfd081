It was found that several RNA\n\ntranscripts mis-spliced by mutant SF3B1 could be used for mutation-specific protein\n\nexpression. The ORAI2 transcript was used to express the Kid toxin in cells harboring the\n\nsplicing mutation, killing them in a mutation-specific manner. Furthermore, the size of the\n\nORAI2 splicing cassette was minimized, and it was found to be responsive to other SF3B1\n\nmutations.\n\nIn Chapter 4 of my dissertation, I help develop an improved doxycycline-inducible\n\ngene expression system called OTetRA. This project was conceived when we were met with\n\nthe difficulty cloning the Kid toxin. Because of the high toxicity of Kid, the original TetOn\n\nsystem is not acceptable due to its basal leakiness in its off state33. The OTetRA system\n\ngreatly lowers the background signal while maintaining the induced signal.\n\nIn Chapter 5 of my dissertation, I help elucidate the roles of chromatin remodeling\n\nprotein HELLS in retinoblastoma by conducting bioinformatic analysis. Retinoblastoma is\n\nan aggressive childhood cancer driven by epigenetic changes but the exact mechanism of\n\nthese epigenetics changes is unknown. Through the mouse model, it was found that loss of\n\nHELLS had little effect on retinal development, but drastically reduced the incidence of\n\nretinoblastoma and increased overall survival.\n\nIn Chapter 6 of my dissertation, I help identify novel regulators of dendrite\n\narborization in Drosophila by conducting bioinformatic analysis. It is difficult to isolate\n\nneuron transcriptomes due to the intricate microenvironments they are in. 5-\n\nethynylcytosine (EC)-tagging was used to specifically tag neuron cells in Drosophila and top\n\n6", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
