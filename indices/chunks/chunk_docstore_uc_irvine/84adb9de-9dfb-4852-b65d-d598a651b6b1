B. In cancers\n\n4\n\nwhere SF3B1 is mutated at K700 or other key residues, the interaction between SF3B1 and\n\nSUGP1 is disrupted. SF3B1 uses the cryptic BP and 3\u2019ss.\n\nWe became particularly interested in this mutated protein because SF3B1 is a core\n\ncomponent of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex of the spliceosome\n\nand is involved in 3\u2019-splice site (3\u2019ss) recognition during RNA splicing (Figure 1-1)29,30.\n\nDuring the 3\u2019ss recognition, the U2AF heterodimer identifies and binds to the poly-\n\npyrimidine tract and the AG dinucleotide of the 3\u2019ss, followed by the binding of SF1\n\n(splicing factor 1) to the branchpoint (BP). SUGP1 (SURP and G-patch domain containing 1)\n\nis then recruited to the 3\u2019 ss via interaction with SF3B1. SUGP1 then recruits an unknown\n\nhelicase which uncouples SF1 from the BP. This allows SF3B1 to replace SF1 and occupy\n\nthe BP. As a result, the canonical BP and 3\u2019ss are used for splicing (Figure 1-1A). However,\n\nwhen SF3B1\u2019s key residues are mutated (e.g. K700E), the interaction between SF3B1 and\n\nSUGP1 are disrupted, and SF3B1 is no longer able to recruit SUGP1, and subsequently, the\n\nhelicase, to the 3\u2019ss. Consequently, the MT SF3B1 cannot displace SF1 from the BP, and is\n\nforced to keep scanning upstream for a suboptimal BP. As a result, the cryptic 3\u2019ss is used\n\nand a longer mRNA transcript is produced (Figure 1-1B).\n\nIn Chapter 2 of my dissertation, I detail the exploratory data analysis on post\n\ntranslational modifications (PTM) on RNA binding proteins (RBP) that I was involved in.\n\nSpecifically, I look at hotspot mutations of the PTM sites in cancers, and the K700E\n\nmutation in SF3B1 is one of the most common PTM mutations in RBPs in cancers. SF3B1\n\nK700E is a pro-oncogenic mutation that leads to alternative splicing by altering\n\nbranchpoint usage31,32 .\n\n5\n\nIn Chapter 3 of my dissertation, I exploit the splicing defect caused by SF3B1 K700E", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
