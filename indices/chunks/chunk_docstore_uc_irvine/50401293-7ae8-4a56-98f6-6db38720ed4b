We focused on phosphorylation as it is well studied and\n\naltered kinase activities are known to be associated with tumorigenesis57. We ranked the\n\ninteracting deposit and removal enzymes (kinase and dephosphorylase, respectively). As is\n\nshown in Figure 2-3D, many of the kinase and dephosphorylase enzymes interacted with a\n\nlarge portion of the total RBP-ome (up to 945 RBPs for kinases and 686 for\n\n25\n\ndephosphorylases). Two notable proteins emerged from this analysis: PTEN and SRC\n\nkinase. Phosphatase and TENsin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a classical\n\ntumor suppressor gene, which possesses lipid and protein phosphatase activities. It has\n\nbeen implicated in numerous studies to control gene expression in tumorigenesis. SRC\n\nkinase is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that transduces signals involved in the\n\ncontrol of a variety of cellular processes and has been demonstrated to be important for the\n\ndevelopment, growth, progression, and metastasis of a number of different cancer\n\ntypes58,59. An intersection of the PTEN-SRC target sets revealed strong overlap between the\n\nRBPs that they interact with and have been demonstrated to be phosphorylated, with 464\n\nRBPs the binding partners of both important proteins (Figure 2-3E). One such RBP stuck\n\nout as a target of both enzymes: DDX5. DDX5 is notable in this case due to its interaction\n\nwith oncogenic transcriptional regulators, such as nuclear factor-\u03ba\u03b2 (NF-\u03ba\u03b2), estrogen\n\nreceptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1), \u03b2-catenin, and P53, and androgen receptor. These interactions, consistent\n\nwith many other protein\u2013protein interactors could be regulated by PTMs and their\n\ndeposition/removal enzymes, of which many have been observed but are not fully studied.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
