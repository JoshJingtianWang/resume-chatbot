Using a Hells conditional\n\nknockout mouse model driven by Chx10-cre recombinase, our results demonstrate\n\nthat Hells-null RPCs divide, undergo cell-fate specification, and give rise to normally\n\nlaminated retinae with all seven major retinal cell types present in normal ratios. While\n\nminor synaptogenesis defects were observed in a subset of bipolar cells, retinal function is\n\nunaltered in the absence of HELLS. Despite the apparent dispensable role of HELLS in\n\nretinal development, here we present evidence that loss of HELLS significantly decreases\n\nthe incidence of retinoblastoma, delays tumor progression, and increases overall survival.\n\n5.4 Results\n\nHells is expressed during retinal development, and repressed following terminal\n\ndifferentiation\n\n101\n\nWe first investigated the normal expression pattern of HELLS in developing retinae.\n\nReal-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of retinal tissue at different\n\ndevelopmental stages showed that Hells mRNA is robustly expressed starting at early\n\nstages of retinal development (E15.5), reaching its maximal expression around postnatal\n\nday 0 (P0) and then gradually declining until it reaches its minimal expression after P6, and\n\nis maintained at low levels thereafter (Figure 5-1B).
