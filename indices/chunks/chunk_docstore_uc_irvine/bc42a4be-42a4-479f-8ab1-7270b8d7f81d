The vectors contain different promoters:\n  - Long SV40-TATA with O-TetR-A\n  - Long SV40-TATA with O-rtTA3\n  - miniCMV with O-TetR-A\n  - An empty vector as a control.\n\n**Part (b): Microscopy Images**\n- These images display the results of cell cultures under different conditions:\n  - The experiment compares \"Un-induced\" (0 \u00b5g/mL Dox) and \"Induced\" (0.5 \u00b5g/mL Dox) conditions.\n  - The rows show the effects of using different vectors:\n    - Long SV40-TATA with O-TetR-A\n    - Long SV40-TATA with rtTA3 only\n    - miniCMV with O-TetR-A\n    - An empty vector.\n  - The images suggest that induction with Dox affects the cell morphology or density, with a noticeable difference between induced and un-induced conditions.\n\n**Part (c): Bar Graphs**\n- The left graph shows GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) expression levels (MFI - Mean Fluorescence Intensity) in un-induced (green bars) and induced (yellow bars) conditions for each vector.\n  - GFP expression is highest in the O-TetR-A with Long SV40-TATA and empty vector groups upon induction.\n  - There is a significant reduction in GFP expression in the induced state compared to the un-induced state for other vectors.\n- The right graph normalizes GFP expression to the un-induced DTA condition and compares O-TetR-A with O-rtTA3 across different vectors.\n  - It indicates consistency in GFP expression levels normalized to the un-induced state, suggesting differential promoter activity.\n\nOverall, the image illustrates the impact of different promoter configurations and doxycycline induction on GFP expression and cell morphology.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-96-18.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
