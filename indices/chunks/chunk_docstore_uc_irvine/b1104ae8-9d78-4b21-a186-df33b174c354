Multidendritic sensory neurons (md neurons)\n\nof Drosophila larvae are commonly used to study peripheral nervous system biology,\n\nparticularly dendrite arborization. We sought to test if EC-tagging, a biosynthetic RNA\n\ntagging and purification method that avoids the caveats of physical isolation, would enable\n\ndiscovery of novel regulators of md neuron dendrite arborization. Our aims were twofold:\n\ndiscover novel md neuron transcripts and test the sensitivity of 5-ethynylcytosine (EC)-\n\ntagging. RNAs were biosynthetically tagged by expressing CD:UPRT (a nucleobase-\n\nconverting fusion enzyme) in md neurons and feeding 5-ethynylcytosine to larvae. Only\n\nCD:UPRT-expressing cells are competent to convert EC into 5-ethynyluridine-\n\nmonophosphate which is subsequently incorporated into nascent RNA transcripts.
