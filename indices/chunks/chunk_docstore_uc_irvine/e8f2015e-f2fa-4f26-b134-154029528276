Since alteration of splicing is prevalent across all cancer types, we\n\nset out to discover more candidates that could be used in place of ORAI2 to target more\n\ncancer cases18. To that end, we adopted the alternative splicing data from a recent\n\nbioinformatic analysis on the splicing landscape across TCGA cancer patients18. Because\n\nalternative splicing is usually tissue-specific, we first removed the cancer patients without\n\nnormal controls with matching tissue of origin 19. Two filters were used to determine the\n\ntop candidate alternative splicing events (CASEs): 1.
