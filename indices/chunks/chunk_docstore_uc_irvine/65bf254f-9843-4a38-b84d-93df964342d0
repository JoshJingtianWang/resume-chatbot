The types of PTMs are color-coded, including acetylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, among others.\n- **Panel B:** Similar to Panel A, but this chart shows the count of mutations occurring within 10 amino acid residues of PTM sites.\n- **Panel C:** A scatter plot showing the count of cancer cases with specific PTM site mutations. Notable mutations like TP53_R213*, TP53_K382Nfs*40, LNRP_N145Tfs*6, and SF3B1_K132N are highlighted.\n- **Panel D:** A circular diagram representing the splicing protein SF3B1. The inner black line indicates per-position mutation frequency, while the outer colored bars represent the types and locations of PTMs.\n- **Panel E:** A structural representation of the SF3B1 protein (in gray) complexed with RNA (in blue). Modified positions are colored according to their PTM type, with the K700 position marked by a black arrow.\n\nThe image collectively highlights the distribution and frequency of mutations at PTM sites in cancer and provides a structural context for these mutations in the SF3B1 protein.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-39-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
