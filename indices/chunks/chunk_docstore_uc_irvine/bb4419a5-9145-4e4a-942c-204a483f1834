The horizontal bars indicate the time periods during which each cell type is generated.\n\n- **Panel B**: A bar graph showing the relative mRNA levels of HELLS at various developmental stages (E15.5, E17.5, P0, P2, P4, P6, P14, P21, P28). The mRNA levels peak around P0 and P2, then gradually decrease over time.\n\n- **Panel C**: Western blot analysis displaying the protein levels of HELLS and TUBULIN (used as a loading control) at the same developmental stages. The HELLS protein levels can be visually assessed and compared across the stages.\n\n- **Panel D**: A line graph plotting the relative protein levels of HELLS across the same developmental stages as in Panel B. The HELLS protein levels initially rise, peaking around P0 to P4, and then sharply decline by P6, remaining low at later stages (P14, P21, P28).\n\nOverall, the data show that both HELLS mRNA and protein levels are highest during early postnatal stages and decrease as development progresses.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-112-20.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
