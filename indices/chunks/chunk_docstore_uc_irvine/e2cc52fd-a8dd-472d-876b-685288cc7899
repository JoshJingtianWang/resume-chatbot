These data points, which are important to catalog to better understand the\n\nregulation of RBPs and thus RNA biology, are represented schematically in Figure 2-1.\n\n18\n\nFigure 2-1. Schematic of PTM identification in the human proteome and RBPome.\n\nClockwise from top left: count of PTM-containing proteins, total number of identified RNA\n\nbinding proteins, count of RNA binding proteins with PTMs, number of cancer mutations\n\nwithin 10 residues of a PTM, number of cancer mutations at a PTM-bearing residue,\n\nnumber of modified proteins which interact with enzymes capable of depositing or\n\nremoving the appropriate PTM.\n\nWe first worked to collate publicly available PTM sites from curated datasets and an\n\nextensive literature search. Experimentally determined PTM sites were aggregated from a\n\nset of 13 publicly available PTM databases21\u201333 and an extensive literature search\n\n(Supplementary Table 2-S1). We found modified sites were widespread, with 13 824 of the\n\n20 239 (68%) human proteins present in SwissProt31 containing one or more PTM sites.\n\nThe union of these datasets resulted in our input set (Figure 2-2A)\n\nTo classify proteins as RNA-binding (the RBP-ome), we combined three existing sets", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
