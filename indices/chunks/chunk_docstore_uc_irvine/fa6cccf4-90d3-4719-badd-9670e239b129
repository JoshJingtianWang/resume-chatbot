Given the absence of a retinal phenotype upon loss of Hells, it\n\nis plausible that compensation by other chromatin remodelers occurs during retinal\n\ndevelopment, something that should be explored in future studies. It is also interesting that\n\n119\n\nmore than twice as many gene expression changes observed in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO\n\ncompared with Rb1/p107 DKO P21 retinae were gene downregulations and that these\n\nchanges were not associated with chromatin structure variations and that global DNA\n\nmethylation was unaltered upon Hells loss.\n\nAmong the most significantly downregulated transcripts in Rb1/p107/Hells, TKO\n\nretinae are genes involved in cell cycle regulation. As reflected by the normal\n\nfunctioning Hells cKO retina, loss of Hells showed no signs of alterations in the proliferation\n\nin retinal progenitor cells; however, we showed that loss\n\nof Hells in Rb1/p107 differentiating retinae drastically reduced cellular proliferation. These\n\nin vivo results are in line with our previous observation in human retinoblastoma cell lines,\n\nshowing reduced proliferative capacity upon HELLS knockdown10. There is a remarkable\n\nsimilarity between the observations in this study and studies on the E2F family. Activating\n\nE2Fs, (aE2Fs: E2F1/2/3) control the transcription of genes required for DNA replication\n\nand proliferation of quiescent cells, but are not required for normal progenitor division in\n\nseveral tissues, including the developing retina32\u201335. However, aE2Fs are essential for\n\nabnormal division of differentiating RB-null cells 32,34\u201336 and removing E2F1 or E2F3\n\ncompletely block retinoblastoma formation10,37. Taken together, we propose that HELLS is\n\na critical downstream mediator of E2F-dependent ectopic division in the Rb1/p107-null", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
