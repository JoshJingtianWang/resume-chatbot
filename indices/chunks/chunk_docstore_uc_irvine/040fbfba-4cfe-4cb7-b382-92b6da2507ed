The ATAC-Seq data have been normalized to take sequencing depth into account.\n\nAll measurements are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u2009=\u20093).\n\nPrevious studies have shown that HELLS is regulated through the RB/E2F pathway\n\nand that loss of RB1 results in upregulation and overexpression of HELLS, a process that\n\nmay contribute to epigenetic changes that drive tumor progression7,8,10. We verified that\n\nHELLS overexpression occurs soon after tumor initiation in Chx10-Cre\n\nRb1lox/lox p107\u2212/\u2212 (Rb1/p107 DKO; Figure 5-3A) retinae and this overexpression persists in\n\nretinoblastoma tumors (Figure 5-3B). To confirm that the RB/E2F pathway directly\n\ncontrols Hells transcription in the retina, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation\n\n(ChIP) analysis using P0 wild-type and P21 Rb1/p107 DKO and Cre-negative littermate\n\ncontrol mouse retinae, as well as human retinoblastoma tumor cells (Weri). Pull-down\n\nusing an E2F1 antibody showed enrichment of E2F1 at a consensus-binding site within\n\n108\n\nthe Hells promoter in samples that highly express HELLS protein: P0 wild-type and\n\nP21 Rb1/p107 DKO retinae and human tumor cells, but not in P21 Cre-\n\nnegative Rb1/p107 (Figure 5-3C).\n\nTo determine whether HELLS is transcriptionally repressed specifically by RB or\n\nalso by other members of the RB family, we analyzed HELLS expression in Chx10-Cre\n\nRb1lox/lox (Rb1 cKO) and Rb1/p107 DKO retinae. Interestingly, we found that in Rb1 cKO\n\nretinae, a mouse model that does not develop retinoblastoma due to compensation by\n\np107, HELLS mRNA and protein expression follows a similar dynamic as wild-type retinae,\n\nwith maximal expression during embryonic stages (E17.5-P0), repression after postnatal\n\nday 2 (P2) and significant reduction in protein levels after postnatal day 6 (P6; Figure 5-\n\n3D). On the other hand, analysis of Rb1/p107 DKO retinae at different stages of retinal\n\ndevelopment, alongside wild-type littermate controls indicate an absence of HELLS", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
