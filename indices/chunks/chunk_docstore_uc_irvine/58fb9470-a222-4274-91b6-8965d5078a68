We also\n\nfound that once tumors were detected, the time to moribund status\n\nfor Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice was on average 13.6 weeks compared to 6.8 weeks\n\nin Rb1/p107 DKO mice (p\u2009=\u20090.0361; Figure 5-4B). This translates to a significant increase of\n\n~16 weeks in the mean survival of tumor-bearing mice from 33.8 weeks for Rb1/p107 DKO\n\nto 49.6 weeks for Rb1/p107/Hells TKO (p\u2009=\u20090.0052). We confirmed that tumors arising\n\nfrom Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice had effectively recombined the conditional Hells alleles\n\nusing western blot analysis (Figure 5-4C).\n\nTumors from Rb1/p107 DKO and Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice were analyzed for gene\n\nexpression using RNA-seq (n\u2009=\u20093 each). Surprisingly, despite the role of HELLS in\n\nheterochromatin formation, the gene expression profile from Hells-null tumors were\n\nvirtually indistinguishable from controls, as portrayed by the PCA plot (Figure 5-4D).\n\nComparative transcriptome analysis of tumors from Rb1/p107 DKO\n\n110\n\nand Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice rendered only 17 significant differential expressed genes\n\n(DEGs; Supplementary Figure 5-4). None of the DEGs provided insightful information\n\nregarding the mechanism by which Hells loss reduced the incidence of retinoblastoma or\n\nimproved survival.\n\n111\n\nFigure 5-4.
