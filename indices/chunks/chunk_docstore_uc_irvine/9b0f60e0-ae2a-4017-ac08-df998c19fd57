To\n\ninvestigate the potential role of PTMs in human disease, we intersected our PTM data with\n\nmutation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (https://www.cancer.gov/tcga). We\n\nidentified 9446 cancer mutations that coincide with the position of categorized PTM\n\nmodified sites in 1727 RBPs (Supplementary Table 2-S3) (Figure 2-4A). We also\n\ncharacterized mutations surrounding PTM sites, as the local structure of proteins is known\n\nto be critical for the recognition of deposition enzymes to control PTM stoichiometry62.\n\nFrom this analysis we identified 100 002 cancer mutations that fall within 10 residues of", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
