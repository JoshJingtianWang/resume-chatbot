Herein we provide the community with the first global analysis of PTM marks on\n\nRNA binding proteins. Our analysis, using experimentally-determined RNA binding\n\n33\n\nproteins and PTM databases reveals that RBPs are modified by a wide variety of PTMs, in\n\nall totaling 69 658 distinct modifications. We also demonstrate that the sites of PTM\n\ndeposition are conserved, with many RNA binding proteins have a high level of diversity of\n\ntheir cataloged PTM modification types.\n\nWe have attempted to create the broadest possible sets of data for PTMs and PPIs;\n\nhowever, sources of bias still exist. Our data are derived from existing literature, and PTMs\n\nare not studied evenly\u2014phosphorylation is the focus of far more studies than other PTMs,\n\nand just four modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and methylation)\n\nmake up the bulk of the available data. Less-studied PTMs may not have enough data to\n\ndraw significant conclusions observed with more common modifications. For PPIs,\n\ndifferent methodologies may miss certain interactions, including transient interactions\n\nwith substrates. We included eight PPI databases, which include both high-throughput and\n\nmore focused experiments, using both physical and genetic techniques, to collect the most\n\ncomplete set of interactions possible; however, it is possible that difficult to detect\n\ninteractions are underrepresented in our interaction data.\n\nIntersection of protein\u2013protein interaction data onto RBP modifications reveals\n\ncomplexity of PTM-depositing enzymes and those that could be responsible for PTM\n\nremoval.
