Two filters were used to determine the\n\ntop candidate alternative splicing events (CASEs): 1. The average Percent spliced-in (PSI) of\n\n55\n\nthe CASE in normal samples must be the same as that of ORAI2\u2019s or better (minimizing the\n\n\u201cleakiness\u201d of the CASE in WT). 2. The disparity between the cancer and normal PSIs of the\n\nCASE must be the same as the SF3B1 K700E to normal PSI ratio of ORAI2 or better, and this\n\ndifference must be statistically significant (filtering for cancer-specific protein expression).\n\nAfter the filtering steps, the CASEs were ranked based on the number of cancer patients\n\nthey cover.\n\nFigure 3-5. Number of patients covered by the CASES vs number of top CASEs\n\nconsidered. Red dotted line indicates total number of TCGA patients eligible for this\n\nanalysis.\n\n56\n\nWe found that among the top CASEs, several events are at the loci of genes\n\nimplicated in cancers (Table 3.1). We hypothesize that the mis-splicings of those genes\n\nserve as potential drivers of tumor progression. We also found that top 20 ranked CASEs\n\nare sufficient to cover over half of all considered TCGA cancer patients (3644/6641 =\n\n54.9%) (Figure 3-3.5). These top CASEs have the potential to increase the generalizability\n\nof our system and be applied to a wide range of cancer patients.\n\n3.5 Discussion\n\nCurrently, the targeting methods of cancer gene therapies are largely limited to\n\ncancer-specific promoters or engineered cancer-specific vectors. If a gene therapy can target\n\nthe inherent faulty biochemistry of a housekeeping protein of the cancer cell, the therapy can\n\npotentially overcome the limitations in targeting dormant or stem-like cancer cells. In this\n\npaper we show the potential to kill the cancer cell by exploiting a defect in its splicing\n\nmachinery. A portion of the ORAI2 gene was chosen and modified to be the splicing RNA\n\nswitch of the system.
