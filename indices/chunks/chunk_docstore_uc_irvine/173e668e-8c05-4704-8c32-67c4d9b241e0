Among the 1021 downregulated genes, we observed\n\nenrichment of pathways involved in DNA replication and cell division (Figure 5-5C).\n\nSince HELLS has a known role in heterochromatin formation, we performed\n\ngenome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility to determine which genes were\n\ndifferentially expressed due to chromatin changes following loss of Hells. For this, we used\n\nATAC-seq to analyze EGFP\u2009+\u2009flow-sorted Rb1/p107/Hells TKO and Rb1/p107 DKO P21\n\nretina cells along with EGFP- control cells. In line with our previous\n\nfindings25, Rb1/p107 DKO retinae displayed increased areas of chromatin accessibility\n\ncompared with control cells (Figure 5-5D). Interestingly, Rb1/p107/Hells TKO compared\n\nwith Rb1/p107 DKO retinae showed only 22 regions of the genome with significant changes\n\nin chromatin accessibility, 19 of which were chromatin repression and only 3 resulting in\n\nchromatin relaxation (Figure 5-5D and data not shown). Further, analysis of global levels of\n\nDNA methylation assessed by dot blot using a 5-mC-specific antibody showed no changes\n\nin genomic 5-mC levels in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO compared with Rb1/p107 DKO and Cre-\n\nnegative control retinae (Supplementary Figure 5). These data suggest that the\n\ntranscriptional changes observed upon Hells loss that result in decreased tumorigenesis\n\nare likely mediated through a mechanism independent of chromatin remodeling.\n\n113\n\nFigure 5-5.
