This led to a novel design for a Tet-ON inducible\n\nsystem including pTet promoter (TetO, miniCMV promoter) to drive target gene expression,\n\nrestriction sites for cloning in a gene of interest, two regulators-TetR and rtTA3 driven by\n\nfull version of CMV promoter and separated by the internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES).\n\nThis new expression vector is named the O-TetR-A system (Figure 4-1a, right).\n\n69\n\nTo assess basal expression from a classic Tet-ON v.s. the O-TetR-A system, we\n\nconstructed two expression vectors: (1) O-rtTA3 containing a single regulator-rtTA3, and (2)\n\nO-TetR-A containing both rtTA3 and TetR transcription factor regulators (Figure 4-1b). Both\n\nvectors share the same DNA backbone sequence, promoter (miniCMV) downstream of TetO\n\nand 6xHis-mCherry downstream the promoter except the O-TetR-A contains the IRES\n\nsequence and a second regulator, TetR, downstream of rtTA3. Due to a weak expression\n\nnature of the original TetO-TetR system, the O-TetR was excluded from this study.\n\n70\n\nFigure 4-1. Novel design of the O-TetR-A (Tet-ON) expression system. A.
