Quantitative PCR amplification was performed using 1\u2009\u00b5l of\n\nreverse-transcribed product in Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (4367659, Life\n\nTechnologies). Reaction were carried out using 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied\n\nBiosciences). Data were normalized to endogenous 18S and GAPDH controls, and analyzed\n\nusing the \u0394\u0394Ct method. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 5-1.\n\nWestern blotting\n\nRetinae were homogenized by pellet pestle in RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH\u2009=\u20098,\n\n150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1\u2009mM EDTA) with added\n\nprotease inhibitor (Mini cOmplete\u2122, Roche). Samples were placed to lyse on ice for 30\u2009min\n\nand then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Assessed protein concentration\n\nusing the BCA protein assay (Pierce\u2122 BCA Protein Assay Kit). In all, 30\u2009\u00b5g of the total\n\nprotein was used, and blot was run on SDS-PAGE gel (Mini-PROTEAN, Bio-rad). The gel was\n\nthen transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P Membrane, EMD Millipore) using a\n\nsemi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-rad). The membrane was incubated in 3% nonfat dry\n\nmilk dissolved in tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.25% Tween (TBS-T) at room\n\ntemperature for an hour in order to prevent nonspecific binding. Primary antibodies were\n\ndiluted in 0.5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T as follows: 1:1000 anti-Hells (sc-28202, Santa\n\nCruz Biotechnology), 1:2000 anti-tubulin (2144S, Cell Signaling Technology). Membranes\n\nwere incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The membranes were washed three\n\ntimes with TBS-T for 5\u2009min per wash then incubated with corresponding secondary\n\n123\n\nantibody for 30\u2009min at room temperature. The secondary antibodies were prepared by\n\ndiluting in 0.5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T as follows: 1:1000 peroxidase labeled anti-mouse\n\nIgG (PI-2000, Vector Laboratories), 1:1000 peroxidase labeled anti-rabbit IgG (PI-1000,", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
