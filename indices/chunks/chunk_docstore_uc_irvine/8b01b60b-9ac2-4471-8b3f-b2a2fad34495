We have shown that Long-SV40-TATA enables the most stringent expression\n\ncontrol of DTA. Collectively, in this study our data demonstrated the Tet-ON inducible design\n\nof Long-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A system comprising of both novel design of promoter and a\n\ncombination of dual regulators (TetR and rtTA3) provides robust induction of target gene\n\nexpression accompanied with minimal noise by tight control of leakiness. In addition,\n\npotential confounding effects due to toxicity of Doxycycline to mitochondrial functions is also\n\nlowered due to reduction of Doxycycline concentration required for induction. The Long-\n\nSV40-TATA O-TetR-A system will facilitate studies that require tight temporal control such\n\n83\n\nas T-cell activation regulation and/or are sensitive to minute expression such as suicide gene\n\nexpression.\n\n84\n\nFigure 4-5.
