Antibodies used were: anti-GFP\n\nantibody (Life Technologies, A11122), anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling\n\nTechnology, 7074S), and Direct-Blot HRP anti-GAPDH antibody (Biolegend, 607904).\n\nImmunofluoresence was detected using the ChemiDoc Imaging System (BIO-RAD).\n\nFlow Cytometry\n\n59\n\nOn the third day post transfection, cells were lifted with trypsin (0.5% EDTA)\n\n(Fisher Scientific) and resuspended in room-temperature flow buffer (PBS with 5% FBS).\n\nFluorescence was measured in the NovoCyte Flow Cytometer (Agilent).\n\nMTT Cell Viability Assay\n\nThe day after transfection, K562 cells of each condition were centrifuged at 500xg\n\nfor 5 minutes and resuspended in 500uL of fresh complete RPMI media with no phenol red\n\n(Life Technologies). K562 cells of each condition were transferred to 96 well plates at\n\n20,000 cells (100uL) per well, 5 wells per plate. To minimize the edge effect, 100uL of PBS\n\nwas added to the wells on the edges of each plate. For MTT assays, 1ug of MTT from the\n\nVybrant MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit was dissolved in 1ml of PBS (Fisher Scientific).\n\nThe 96-well plate was centrifuged at 500xg for minutes. Fifty microliter of media was\n\ncarefully removed from each well. MTT solution was diluted with 5 parts of RPMI media\n\nwith no phenol red and added to each well at 60uL per well. The plate was then incubated\n\nat 37C for 30 minutes. The 96-well plate was centrifuged at 500xg for minutes and 85uL of\n\nMTT/media mixture was carefully removed from each well. Formazan crystals in each well\n\nwas dissolved with 150uL of DMSO by pipetting up and down slowly. Optical density was\n\nread in the CLARIOstar Plus Microplate Reader at 560nm (BMG LABTECH). Reads were\n\nblank-corrected and normalized to WT or MT negative controls (negative controls were\n\ntransfected with filler plasmid).\n\nSplicing Data Analysis\n\nThree prime alternative splicing PSI data was downloaded from", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
