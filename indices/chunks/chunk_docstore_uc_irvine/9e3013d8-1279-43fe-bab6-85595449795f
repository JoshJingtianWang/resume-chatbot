Based on a previously described neural EC-tagging\n\ntime-course8, we estimate it takes six hours before ingested 5EC is metabolized to the point\n\nthat widespread RNA tagging occurs in target neurons. The twelve-hour 5EC feeding is\n\ntherefore expected to generate a population of tagged RNAs synthesized over\n\napproximately six hours. At the end of EC feeding, larval carcass (containing primarily\n\nmuscle, epidermis and the peripheral neurons of interest) was dissected to remove CNS\n\nneurons that express Gal4109(2)80. A reference sample was prepared by feeding 5-\n\nethynyluridine (5EUd) to stage-matched UAS-CD:UPRT larvae, in the absence of any Gal4.\n\n5EUd is incorporated into RNA independent of CD:UPRT and thus provides a reference\n\ncontaining mRNAs transcribed in all cells over the same labeling period. As a negative\n\ncontrol, we prepared \u201cmock-tagged\u201d samples in which larvae were not fed 5EC or 5EUd but\n\nwere subjected to the same carcass dissection and RNA processing. The mock sample\n\nserves as a control for the stringency of the purification and allows identification of\n\ntranscripts that may be purified independent of EC-tagging. This type of mock reference\n\nhas proven useful in other biosynthetic RNA labeling experiments11,12.\n\nFor all three sample types (5EC-tagged, 5EUd-tagged and mock-tagged), equal\n\namounts of total RNA were biotinylated and applied to streptavidin beads. RNA captured\n\non the beads was directly used to prepare sequencing libraries. The number of mapped\n\nreads per sample agreed with the expected yield of tagged RNA: 5EUd-tagging (expected\n\nhigh yield, RNA tagging in all cells) gave 48\u201356.6 million reads, 5EC-tagging (expected low\n\nyield, RNA tagging only in rare md neurons) gave 2.7\u20137.7 million reads, and mock-tagging", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
