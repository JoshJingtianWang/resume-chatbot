ERG measures the electrical activity\n\nof the various cell types in the retina in response to light stimulation. The a-wave\n\nhyperpolarization measures photoreceptor (cone and rod) function and the b-wave\n\ndepolarization measures the inner retinal function, predominantly M\u00fcller and bipolar cells.\n\nAlthough Hells cKO mice tend to show a lower a-wave and b-wave amplitude, ERG\n\nrecordings show neither significant changes in the amplitude of the a-wave, except at the\n\nhighest light intensity (Figure 5-2G), nor the amplitude of the b-wave (Figure 5-2H),\n\nconsistent with the observation that photoreceptors and inner neuron cells are comparable\n\nin numbers between Hells cKO and littermate controls.\n\n106\n\nHells is transcriptionally repressed by the Rb family\n\nFigure 5-3.
