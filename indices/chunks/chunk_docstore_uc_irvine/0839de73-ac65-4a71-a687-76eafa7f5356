As such, it seems that\n\nthe altered K700E ubiquitin site is likely altering ubiquitin deposition and splicing. It has\n\nbeen demonstrated previously that ubiquitin can control protein\u2013protein interactions\n\ninvolving splicing component assembly and that alterations in ubiquitin stoichiometry can\n\nlead to defects in RNA splicing65,66. The lysine at position 700 is in close proximity to the\n\npre-mRNA in the complex (Figure 2-4E); disruption of ubiquitination by mutation to\n\nglutamic acid may influence interactions with the pre-mRNA and recognition of the\n\nbranchpoint sequence, leading to increased splicing at cryptic sites67. The analysis provided\n\nherein provides a roadmap for testing such hypotheses as it relates to PTM sites on RBPs\n\nthat are mutated in disease.\n\nRelationship between PTM sites and the RNA\u2013protein interface\n\nRNA binding proteins function through their interaction with RNA molecules to\n\nregulate RNA structure and function. The presence of thousands of PTM sites prompted us\n\nto make headway in understanding the relationship between RNA binding and PTM\n\noccupancy in protein sequence space. There are now many published reports cataloging\n\n29\n\nthe cross-linked sites between RNAs and proteins through UV-mediated crosslinking.\n\nThese reports provide amino-acid resolution of the RNA\u2013protein interface (Figure 2-\n\n5A)45,47,68. We sought to intersect these datasets with our PTM database to better\n\nunderstand the potential relationship between RNA binding and PTM deposition.\n\nFigure 2-5. A.
