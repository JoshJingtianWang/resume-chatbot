Three candidate genes encoding RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) were tested for\n\na role in md neuron dendrite arborization. Loss-of-function for the m6A-binding factor\n\nYthdc1 did not cause any dendrite arborization defects while RNAi of the other two\n\ncandidates, the poly(A) polymerase Hiiragi and the translation regulator Hephaestus,\n\ncaused significant defects in dendrite arborization. This work provides an expanded view\n\nof transcription in md neurons and a technical framework for combining EC-tagging with\n\nRNA-seq to profile transcription in cells that may not be amenable to physical isolation.\n\n135\n\n6.3 Introduction\n\nNeuron development requires regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional\n\nand post-transcriptional levels. Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons\n\nprovide a useful model for investigating these mechanisms. Sensory neurons of the larval\n\nPNS are classified according to dendrite morphology: external sensory and chordotonal\n\nneurons have a single dendrite, bipolar dendrite neurons have two unbranched dendrite\n\nprojections, and multidendritic (md) neurons have more complex dendritic arborization.\n\nMd neurons innervate the larval body wall and function as touch receptors, proprioceptors,\n\nthermoreceptors or nociceptors. Md neurons have proven useful for investigating the\n\nmolecular mechanisms that control dendrite arborization1.
