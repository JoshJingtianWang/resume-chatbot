Each read pair was allowed a maximum number of\n\nmismatches of 10. Each read was allowed a maximum number of multiple alignments of 3.\n\nGene counts for each sample were produced using HTSeq (v0.6.1p1)40.

Genes with low reads (sum across samples <10) were removed.\n\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEG) were calculated by comparing Rb1/p107/Hells TKO\n\nto Rb1/p107 DKO, genes with base mean \u226510, Log2FoldChange\u2009\u2265\u20091 or\u2009\u2264\u2009\u22121, and\n\nadjusted p value (Benjamini\u2013Hockberg)\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were called differentially expressed genes.\n\n3D PCA plot was generated using the R package plot3D (v1.1.1).\n\nChromatin profiling\n\nApproximately 50,000 cells were harvested for ATAC-seq for each replicate. Briefly,\n\nretinae were dissociated, flow sorted into EGFP\u2212 or EGFP\u2009+\u2009, assessed for cell viability,\n\ncounted, and washed with PBS. ATAC-seq was performed as previously described42. ATAC-\n\nseq libraries were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 4000 using 100\u2009bp paired-end single\n\nindexed run. Raw reads were first QCed (FASTQC) and quality and adapter trimmed\n\nusing Trimmomatic. Trimmed reads were then aligned to mm10 build of the mouse genome\n\nusing Bowtie2 (v2.2.5) with alignment parameters: bowtie2 -X 2000\u2013 local\u2013dovetail.\n\nPotential PCR duplicate reads were removed using MarkDuplicates from the Picard tools.\n\nPeaks were called in each sample using MACS2 and further filtered using the ENCODE\n\nconsensus blacklist regions\n\n(http://mitra.stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/mm10-mouse/).\n\nDifferential peaks were identified using R package diffbind across the consolidated peak\n\nsets and metrics such as adjusted p values were reported.
