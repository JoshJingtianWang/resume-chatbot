Cells in the \"Inactive Kid\" condition appear more confluent and healthy compared to the \"Kid\" condition, where cells seem less dense and possibly undergoing cell death.\n- The bottom row (mCherry) shows fluorescence images indicating the presence of a reporter protein. The \"Inactive Kid\" condition has more fluorescence, while the \"Kid\" condition shows much less, suggesting the toxin's effect on the cells.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-64-9.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
