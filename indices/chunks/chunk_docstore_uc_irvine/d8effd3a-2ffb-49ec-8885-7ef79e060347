The images show the dendritic structures of neurons, with the cell body located at the lower left of each image. The larva's anterior is to the left, and the dorsal is at the top.\n\n- **Control**: Displays the typical dendritic arborization pattern.\n- **ythdc1 -/-**: Shows altered dendritic branching compared to the control.\n- **heph RNAi**: Exhibits a distinct dendritic structure.\n- **hrg RNAi**: Shows changes in dendritic patterns.\n- **Caper RNAi**: Displays significant differences in dendritic arborization.\n\n### Panel B:\nThis panel includes three box plots that quantify different aspects of dendritic arborization across the same conditions presented in Panel A.\n\n1. **Number of Branch Termini**: \n   - Control: Baseline number of branch termini.\n   - ythdc1 -/-: Significant reduction (****) in branch termini compared to control.\n   - heph RNAi: Significant reduction (****).\n   - hrg RNAi: Moderate reduction (**).\n   - Caper RNAi: No significant change (NS).\n\n2. **Dendritic Field (% Coverage)**:\n   - Control: Baseline dendritic field coverage.\n   - ythdc1 -/-: No significant difference (NS).\n   - heph RNAi: Significant reduction (**).\n   - hrg RNAi: Significant reduction (***).\n   - Caper RNAi: No significant change (NS).\n\n3. **Number of Termini / Dendritic Field**:\n   - Control: Baseline number of termini per dendritic field.\n   - ythdc1 -/-: No significant change (NS).\n   - heph RNAi: Slight increase (*).\n   - hrg RNAi: No significant change (NS).\n   - Caper RNAi: Significant increase (****).", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-157-29.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
