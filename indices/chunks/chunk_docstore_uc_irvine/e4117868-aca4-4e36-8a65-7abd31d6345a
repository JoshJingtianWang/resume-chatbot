Z/EG mice were obtained from Dr. Itsuki Ajioka\n\n(Tokyo Medical and Dental University). Hellslox/lox mice were obtained from the European\n\nMouse Mutant Archive, backcrossed to Flp mice for removal of the neo-cassette (tm1c\n\nconversion), and then backcrossed to C57BL/6N mice for final Flp removal (Figure 5-2A).\n\nAll mice are maintained in a C57BL/6N background, and both sexes were used in the\n\nanalysis. Mice were monitored weekly, unblinded, for signs of retinoblastoma and anterior\n\nchamber invasion for 1 year from the time of birth. Moribund status was defined as the\n\npoint when tumor cells invaded the anterior chamber and intraocular pressure increased\n\nto the point of imminent ocular rupture. The University of California Irvine Institutional\n\nAnimal Care and Use Committee approved all animal procedures. Survival curves were\n\ngenerated using GraphPad Prism. Mantel\u2013Cox test was used for statistical analysis of the\n\nKaplan\u2013Meier curves. Using trends from previous studies10, we have found that 20 mice\n\nper group were sufficient to accurately measure differences in survival with an 80% power\n\nat 0.05 significance level in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO compared with Rb1/p107 DKO mice.\n\nReal-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR)\n\n122\n\nRNA was isolated from retinal tissue by homogenizing samples using Trizol Reagent\n\nand then isolated using chloroform.
