On the other hand, analysis of Rb1/p107 DKO retinae at different stages of retinal\n\ndevelopment, alongside wild-type littermate controls indicate an absence of HELLS\n\nrepression in Rb1/p107 DKO mice after P4, observed both at protein (Figure 5-3E, F) and\n\ntranscriptional (Figure 5-3G) levels. Analysis of chromatin accessibility at the Hells locus\n\nusing ATAC-seq of P21 retinae confirmed a significant increase in reads at\n\nthe Hells promoter and along the first two exons in EGFP-positive\n\n(Rb\u2212/\u2212/p107\u2212/\u2212) compared with EGFP-negative (p107\u2212/\u2212) flow-sorted Rb/p107 DKO retinal\n\ncells (Figure 5-3H). Since HELLS expression levels in Rb1/p107 DKO retinae are\n\ncomparable with those observed in wild-type retinae between E17.5 and P2 and chromatin\n\nremains open in EGFP\u2009+\u2009Rb/p107 DKO P21 retinal cells, these results suggest that RB-family\n\nmembers are required for Hells repression during terminal differentiation of one or several\n\nretinal cell fates to block access of E2F1 at the Hells promoter.\n\n109\n\nLoss of Hells reduces tumorigenesis in a genetic mouse model of retinoblastoma\n\nA previous study in retinoblastoma identified HELLS as a key target gene that\n\npromotes tumor proliferation10. To determine if HELLS overexpression is critical for\n\nretinoblastoma development, we generated Chx10-Cre Rblox/lox p107\u2212/\u2212 Hellslox/lox triple\n\nknockout (Rb1/p107/Hells TKO) mice and compared them to Rb1/p107 DKO littermate\n\ncontrols. Rb1/p107/Hells TKO and Rb1/p107 DKO mice were followed for 1 year beginning\n\nat birth for signs of tumor development. We found that abrogation of Hells led to a\n\nsignificant increase in survival and decreased morbidity in Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice\n\ncompared with their Rb1/p107 DKO littermate controls (Figure 5-4A). We observed that\n\nonly 16% of Rb1/p107/Hells TKO mice (n\u2009=\u200925) developed tumors compared with 72%\n\nof Rb1/p107 DKO mice (n\u2009=\u200918; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) in the span of 1 year (Figure 5-4A).
