The graph suggests that covering the first 20 top events covers approximately 4000 patients, and after that, the rate of increase in patients covered diminishes.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-68-11.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
