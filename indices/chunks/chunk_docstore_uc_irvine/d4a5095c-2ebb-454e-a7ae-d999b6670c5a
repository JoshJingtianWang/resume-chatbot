Flow replicates: n = 4. Error bars are standard\n\ndeviation of the mean.\n\nMiniCMV is derived from a robust constitutive CMV promoter and widely used in the\n\nTet-ON system but it also inherently comes with high basal expression level when utilized in\n\nan inducible vector context. Such promoter design would not be a viable option for\n\ntemporally controlling expression of a toxic gene. Thus, to further cut down basal expression\n\nof the O-TetR-A, we next focused on promoter design which normally sits downstream of\n\nTetO.\n\nStudies by Ede, C et al.21 and Hansen, J et al.22 showed that the synthetic YB-TATA\n\npromoter, originally designed by Benenson\u2019s laboratory, has very low level of basal\n\nexpression comparing to the miniCMV in various inducible vectors. Thus, we replaced the\n\nentire miniCMV sequence with the YB-TATA promoter sequence (Figure 4-2a) resulting\n\nLong-YB-TATA vectors in both versions of the tet-inducible mCherry expression O-rtTA3 and\n\nthe O-TetR-A. These Long-YB-TATA vectors were used to transfect HEK293 cells. After 48h\n\n73\n\npost induction with 0.5\u00b5g/mL Dox, cells were harvested for flow cytometry and immunoblot\n\nanalyses.\n\nBy flow cytometry, both single (O-rtTA3) and dual (O-TetR-A) regulators containing\n\nexpression vectors showed a 3-fold increase in SNR indicating a reduction in basal\n\nexpression of Long-YB-TATA promoter (Figure 4-2b). To further evaluate background signal,\n\nwe took advantage of the signal amplification nature of the sandwich immunoblot approach\n\nto stringently assess any basal signal from these constructs. Total protein from transfected\n\ncells was isolated and subjected to immunoblot analysis using 2.5\u00b5g/sample. The blot was\n\nprobed with anti-His Ab and displayed robust 6xHis-mCherry signal in all induced samples", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
