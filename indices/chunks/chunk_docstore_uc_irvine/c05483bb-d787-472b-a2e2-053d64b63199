MT cells exhibit a substantially higher GFP MFI than WT cells.\n\n**Panel B:**\n- A bar graph illustrating the results of an MTT growth assay over four days. The assay compares the optical density of WT and MT K562 cells nucleofected with the ORAI2-T2A-Kid (J) plasmid. Results indicate a notable decrease in optical density over time, more prominently in MT cells.\n\n**Panel C:**\n- Schematic diagrams of three versions of ORAI2-Kid constructs (K, J, and L) and their proposed mechanisms. These include different configurations and elements such as the Kid toxin, Kis antitoxin, IRES, and MAP3K7, highlighting distinctions between old and new versions for cancer and normal cells.\n\n**Panel D:**\n- Microscopy images of WT and MT K562 cells three days post nucleofection with construct K or a control, showing cell density and morphology.\n- An accompanying bar graph presents MTT growth assay results for WT and MT K562 cells nucleofected with the three versions of ORAI2-Kid constructs (J, K, L), indicating optical density over four days.\n\nOverall, the image demonstrates the efficiency of different ORAI2-Kid constructs in reducing cell viability, particularly in mutant SF3B1 K562 cancer cells, using flow cytometry, MTT growth assays, schematics of constructs, and microscopy.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824/figure-66-10.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
