To address potential non-\n\nspecific purification among the enriched transcripts, we compared transcript levels\n\nbetween EC-RNA and mock-RNA. This comparison identified 85 transcripts with no\n\nsignificant enrichment compared to mock-RNA, thus reducing the list of md neuron\n\ntranscripts to 852. Similar background correction for depleted transcripts is not possible\n\nsince transcripts that are rare or absent in md neurons are expected to be low in EC-RNA\n\nand mock-RNA. In the background-corrected dataset, known md neuron transcripts are\n\namong the most significantly enriched and known muscle-specific transcripts are among\n\nthe most significantly depleted (Figure 6-1). The top 60 enriched or depleted genes are\n\nlisted in Figure 6-2 and the complete DE results are provided in S6-1 Table. EC-RNA\n\ncompared to the subset ref-RNA yielded 571 enriched transcripts and 130 depleted\n\ntranscripts (minimum two-fold difference and adjusted p-value < 0.05) and the background\n\ncorrection procedure removed 39 transcripts from the enriched list (S6-1 Table). Enriched\n\nand depleted transcripts were similar regardless of the type of ref-RNA used (commonly\n\nenriched transcripts are denoted in S6-1 Table). We also performed gene ontology (GO)\n\nanalysis on the complete ref-RNA DE results (Figure 6-3) and the subset ref-RNA DE\n\nresults (S6-2 Fig). Both approaches yielded multiple neuron-specific GO categories\n\nincluding \u201cperipheral nervous system development\u201d and \u201cdendrite morphogenesis\u201d. The\n\n\u201csynaptic growth at neuromuscular junction\u201d GO category reflects the fact that enriched\n\n141\n\ngenes in this category function in the synapses of motor neurons and md sensory neurons.\n\nNon-neural GO categories, \u201cdorsal closure\u201d and \u201cborder follicle cell migration\u201d, reflect the\n\nfact that many neurite growth or morphogenesis genes (e.g. stathmin, shot, kay, shn, aop)", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
