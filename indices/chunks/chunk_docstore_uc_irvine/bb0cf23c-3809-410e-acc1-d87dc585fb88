The ORAI2 splicing\n\ncassette was then cloned upstream of Kid and transfected into wild type K562 cells (WT) or\n\nK562 CRISPR cell line with the SF3B1 K700E mutation (MT). MTT cell viability assay\n\nshowed that ORAI2-T2A-Kid negatively affected MT cells growth more than WT cells\n\n(Figure 3-4b). However, the toxicity was high in both cell types.\n\nTo lower the unwanted toxicity of our design in WT, the Kis antitoxin was\n\nintroduced downstream of Kid, under the control of an Internal Ribosomal Entry Site\n\n(IRES) (Figure 3-4c). Since MAP3K7 is the \u201cleakier\u201d splicing cassette and expresses more\n\ncargo protein in WT compared to ORAI2, it was inserted between IRES and Kis. In an\n\nalternative design, two T2A peptides were introduced between IRES and Kis to lower the\n\nexpression of Kis17. These two designs will constitutively express low trace amount of Kis,\n\nneutralizing the Kid leaked in WT cells, but still sparing enough Kid toxin in MT cells to\n\nexert cell-killing effect. To test these scenarios, MTT assay was deployed to assess cell\n\nviability. MTT cell viability assay showed that the new designs had less toxicity in WT cells\n\nwhile still maintaining similar toxicity in MT cells compared to the original ORAI2-T2A-Kid\n\n(Figure 3-4d). When ORAI2 splicing cassette was applied to the pro-apoptotic factor PUMA,\n\nit also showed MT-specific cell killing (Figure 3-S2).\n\n53\n\nFigure 3-4.
