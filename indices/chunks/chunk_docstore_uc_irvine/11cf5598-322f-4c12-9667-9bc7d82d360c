Of these RBPs the\n\nvast majority are highly modified, with 2381 RBPs (95%) modified at a minimum of one\n\nsite (Supplementary Table 2-S2). This is a significantly higher proportion of modification\n\nthan in the full set of human proteins (chi-squared test, P = 9.87 \u00d7 10\u2013170).\n\nPhosphorylation was the most common modification, though acetylation, ubiquitination,\n\nand methylation were also present in over half of RBPs (Figure 2-2A). A total of 19\n\nindividual PTMs were significantly more common in RBPs than in all proteins, including\n\nacetylation, caspase, citrullination, glutathionylation, glycosylation, hydroxylation,\n\nmethylation, myristoylation, N6-malonyllysine, nitrosylation, oxidation, palmitoylation,\n\n19\n\nphosphorylation, sulfenylation, succinylation, sulfenic acid, sumoylation, ubiquitination,\n\nand Zn-Cys modifications (Chi-squared tests with Bonferroni correction, P < 0.05). These\n\ndata highlight the potential complexity of PTM sites on RBPs.\n\nFigure 2-2. Sites of post-translational modification in RNA binding proteins. A. Count\n\nof RBPs with each PTM type. B. Counts of different PTM types per RBP. Location and PTM\n\ntype are indicated on circular inset plots for six example RBPs with low and high PTM type\n\ncounts. C.
