Fusion amplicons were cloned into\n\npTREtight2 (a gift from Dr. Markus Ralser, Addegene# 19407) via PciI site to make pKN411\n\n= version 1 of O-rtTA3 vector. Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CAP) binding\n\nsequence located upstream of TetO in pKN411 was removed, resulting pKN426 = O-rtTA3.\n\nb.\n\nConstruction of O-TetR-A (dual regulators) vector: Sequence of TetR from pJZ300 and\n\nsequence of IRES from pWIG-nFLAG-PGA-IRES-EGFP (a gift from Dr Michael S. Cohen at\n\n85\n\nOregon Health & Science University) were amplified individually then fused together via\n\nPCR. Fusion amplicons were cloned into pKN426 via BsrGI to make pKN430 = O-TetR-A\n\nvector.\n\nc.\n\nConstruction of YB-TATA promoter in O-rtTA3 and O-TetR-A vectors via two steps:\n\nStep 1: miniCMV sequence located downstream TetO of pTREtight2 was removed by\n\ndigesting with RsaI resulting 3 fragments (71nt, 923 nt & 1938nt). The two large\n\nfragments were gel purified and self-ligated to become pKN437. YB-TATA promoter\n\n(long version, dsOligo oKN586F & 587R) was cloned into pKN437 via XmaI to become\n\npKN438.\n\nStep 2: TetO-YB-TATA promoter fragment was cleaved from pKN438 then gel-\n\npurified and subsequently cloned into pKN426 and pKN430 via PspXI and BamHI to\n\nmake pKN442 (YB-TATA O-rtTA3) and pKN443 (YB-TATA O-TetR-A).\n\nd.\n\nConstruction of different TATA boxes into O-TetR-A backbone using the same\n\napproach described in (c).\n\ne.\n\nConstruction of Diptheria toxin containing vectors: \u201cLong SV40 TATA OTetRA DTA\"\n\n(plJW0036), \"Long SV40 TATA rtTA3 only DTA\" (plJW0037), \"miniCMV OTetRA DTA\"", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
