This leakiness can lead to harmful side\n\neffects in patients, especially if the transgene encodes a toxic protein. Herein, my studies\n\naim to invent, as well as improve upon regulatory tools to control transgene expression in\n\ncancer gene therapies. Compared to the traditional promoter-based or cell surface marker-\n\nbased approaches, my approach targets an intracellular protein defect caused by several\n\nmutations that are prevalent in cancers. Additionally, I improved the inducible gene\n\nexpression system, further eliminating its background leakiness. Together, my studies offer\n\nnovel cell-specific targeting and temporal control options, expanding the current gene\n\ntherapy toolbox.\n\nxi\n\nChapter 1: Background\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nCancer and Cancer Stem Cells\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer accounted for nearly\n\none in six deaths worldwide. CDC projection shows that annual number of cancer cases in\n\nthe US will increase by almost 50% from 1.5 million in 2015to 2.3 million in 2050, as a\n\nresult of the aging US population1.\n\nCancer is caused by the accumulation of genetic or epigenetic alterations of the\n\ngenome. The resulting phenotypes of human cancers are extremely complex and dynamic\n\nand often comprise the following: sustained proliferative signaling, evasion of growth\n\nsuppressors, ability to induce and access vasculature, reprogrammed cellular metabolism,\n\nand ability to avoid immune destruction2. In recent years, the existence of cancer stem cells\n\n(CSCs) has become increasingly accepted2. CSCs are a subpopulation of cancer cells that", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
