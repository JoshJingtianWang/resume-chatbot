Cell pellets subjected to protein isolation were re-\n\nsuspended with 100 -150 \u03bcL (10x volume of dried cell pellet) RIPA lysis buffer [50mM Tris-\n\nHCl at pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate & 0.1%SDS, 5mM EDTA),\n\nsupplemented with 4 \u03bcL of proteinase inhibitor cocktail Set VII (EMB, Cat#: 539138-1ML), 4\n\n\u03bcL Turbo DNase (Life Tech., Cat# AM2239), 4 \u03bcL RNaseA (Thermo Fisher, Cat# FEREN0531)\n\nper milliliter of RIPA lysis buffer], was added.
