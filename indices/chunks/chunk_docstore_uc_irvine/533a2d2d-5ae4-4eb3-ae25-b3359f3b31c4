Inspection of the crystal structure overlaid with the PTM sites we\n\nobserved diverse PTMs surrounding the RNA interface of the RNA recognition motif (RRM).\n\nOne notable site of PTM mutation in cancers at the RRM motif is arginine 64 (R64; Figure 2-\n\n5D). Arginines are known to be sites of methylation on hnRNPs; this methylation controls\n\ntheir nuclear export74 and can alter their ability to bind to nucleic acids by altering arginine\n\n32\n\ncharge. In addition, hnRNPs contain about 65% of the total methylated arginine found in\n\nthe cell nucleus75. The interface of methylated sites on hnRNPs may be a central hub of\n\nadvanced regulation. Overall, our analysis provides a better understanding of the PTM\n\nlandscape and how this intersects with the RNA\u2013RBP interface. Further inspection of\n\nindividual PTM sites and their mutations in cancer should prove valuable for analysis of\n\nspecific PTMs that may contribute to RBP function, RNA regulation, and potentially\n\noncogenesis.\n\nAn online database for access to the RBP PTM atlas\n\nTo provide the community with a working database for the ease of access to the\n\ndata analyses herein, we have hosted an online database for the PTM atlas. We created a\n\nMySQL database and imported the data corresponding to 2436 RNA-binding proteins\n\n(RBPs) together with the corresponding information about 47 types of post-translational\n\nmodification (PTMs). In total, there are 280 708 entries in the database, and each entry\n\ncontains information about the RBP\u2019s Uniprot ID, gene name, position, PMID, Ssource,\n\nAmino Acid (AA), modification type, cell line, sample type, body site, and disease state. The\n\ndatabase is publicly searchable by RBP Uniprot ID or by gene name and corresponding\n\nPTM type through the web server located at: http://PTM-RBP-ATLAS.igb.uci.edu/.\n\n2.6 Discussion\n\nRNA biology is tightly controlled through its interactions with RNA binding proteins.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
