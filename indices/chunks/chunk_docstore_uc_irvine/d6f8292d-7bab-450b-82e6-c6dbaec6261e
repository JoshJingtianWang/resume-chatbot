Thus, we aimed to develop an improved\n\nTet-ON system that increases Dox sensitivity and robust activation of transgene expression\n\nand yet decreases basal noise by focusing on pTet promoter design and dual Tet-responsive\n\nregulators in a single unit.\n\n68\n\nHere in this study, we demonstrate a novel design of Tet-ON inducible system called\n\nLong-SV40-TATA O-TetR-A vector that improves both expression robustness and level of\n\nleakiness as well as Dox sensitivity.\n\n4.4 Results and Discussion\n\nTo overcome the high basal expression of a gene of interest from a widely used Tet-\n\nON inducible system, we incorporate both tetracycline repressor (TetR) and tetracycline-\n\ncontrolled transactivator (rtTA), a variant of TetR fused with VP16, a single Tet-inducible\n\nexpression vector.\n\nBoth of transcription factors, TetR and rtTA, are able to bind to tetracycline\n\nresponsive element (TetO) and tetracycline or doxycycline but work in an opposite manner.\n\nIn the absence of doxycycline, rtTA (or its third generation rtTA3) does not bind to TetO,\n\ntherefore, does not activate transcription (Figure 4-1a, left); however, TetR binds to TetO\n\nand represses transcription (Figure 4-1a, middle). In the presence of doxycycline, rtTA binds\n\nto doxycycline and is able to bind TetO and activate transcription (Figure 4-1a, left) whereas\n\nTetR is unable to bind to TetO and thus no longer represses transcription (Figure 4-1a,\n\nmiddle). This unique regulatory property of rtTA and TetR on the same Tet responsive\n\nelements enables a tight control on expression of a gene of interest if expressing in the same\n\ncell or in the same expression cassette. This led to a novel design for a Tet-ON inducible\n\nsystem including pTet promoter (TetO, miniCMV promoter) to drive target gene expression,", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/UC Irvine/JW_Dissertation_20220824.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
