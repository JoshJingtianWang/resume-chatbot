The training F1 score increases steadily over the epochs, reaching above 0.80 by the 10th epoch. The validation F1 score also increases initially but then fluctuates slightly, peaking around the 6th epoch and then slightly decreasing towards the 10th epoch, staying below the training F1 score and reaching just below 0.70.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-12-15.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
