The x-axis represents the Ground Truth UV Energy in Joules (J), ranging from 0 to 200. The y-axis represents the UV Energy Error in percentage (%), ranging from -50% to 100%.\n\nTwo lines are plotted on the graph:\n- A blue line representing the U-Net_L1 model.\n- An orange line representing the cGAN_L1 model.\n\nThe shaded regions around each line likely represent confidence intervals or variability in the data.\n\nKey observations:\n- The UV Energy Error for both models decreases as the Ground Truth UV Energy increases.\n- The cGAN_L1 model (orange line) generally shows lower error values compared to the U-Net_L1 model (blue line), particularly at lower energy values.\n- The shaded region for the U-Net_L1 model is larger, indicating more variability compared to the cGAN_L1 model.\n\nOverall, the cGAN_L1 model appears to perform better with more consistent and lower UV Energy Error across the range of Ground Truth UV Energy values.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-15.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
