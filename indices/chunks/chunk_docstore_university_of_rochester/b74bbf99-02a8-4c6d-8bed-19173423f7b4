This might reduce dimensionality and reduce overfitting.\n\nUsing 5-fold cross validation, Pycaret chose a best perform- ing model for each county. Hyperparameter tuning was done using the Bayesian Search from the scikit-optimize package [8].\n\nIn the end, this ensemble technique resulted in an R2 of\n\n0.89308.\n\nB. non-Machine Learning Approach\n\nWhen building machine learning models, we noticed that the features \u201dday\u201d and \u201ddeaths\u201d are routinely among the strongest predictors for daily COVID cases (Figure 6). We decided to plot the daily COVID cases by county to visualize its relationship with \u201dday\u201d (Figure 7). We noticed a uniformly upward trend for all counties. This gave us the idea to use a simple rule-based heuristic to predict the daily COVID cases.\n\nFig. 7. Daily COVID Cases by County by Day.\n\nSince the test data is the perfect complement of the training data, for each test data point, we use its adjacent earlier and later training data points to calculate a \u201ddaily case increase rate\u201d at the day of that test data point:\n\nrate: cases prev:\n\ncases next:\n\ndays diff:\n\nrate\n\ndaily case increase rate number of cases of the previous train- ing data point number of cases of the later training data point number of days between the later and the previous training data point \u201c cases next\u00b4cases prev days diff\n\nWith the rate, we can calculate the cases at the test data\n\npoint using this equation:\n\ncases test:\n\ndays diff test:\n\ncases test\n\nnumber of cases on the test day of interest number of days between the test data point and the previous training data point \u201c cases prev ` days diff test \u02c6 rate", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
