Each bar represents a county, with the height of the bar corresponding to the aggregated mean awareness value for that county. The counties are listed along the x-axis, and the aggregated mean awareness values are shown on the y-axis. \n\nThe counties with the highest awareness values are positioned on the left side of the chart, progressively decreasing as one moves to the right. The values range from approximately 0.035 for the highest county to nearly 0.000 for the lowest. The chart effectively shows a descending trend in awareness values across the counties.

The aggregated mean awareness value for each county.\"", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report/figure-2-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
