The x-axis represents the seasons, while the y-axis represents a variable labeled \"new_p\" with values ranging from 0.0 to 0.7. The bars are grouped by season and are color-coded based on a variable labeled \"social,\" with different colors representing different categories within this variable. The colors used are red, green, blue, and purple. Each season has four associated bars, indicating the performance or value of \"new_p\" for each social category during that season. The chart shows variations in \"new_p\" across different seasons and social categories.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-29-19.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
