At the top, the color starts with a bright red, which fades into orange, then transitions to yellow. Moving further down, the gradient shifts into green, followed by shades of turquoise. The lower half of the image transitions through shades of blue and finally ends in a deep blue at the bottom. There are a few horizontal black lines, particularly in the middle and bottom sections, adding subtle interruptions to the smooth gradient.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-10.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
