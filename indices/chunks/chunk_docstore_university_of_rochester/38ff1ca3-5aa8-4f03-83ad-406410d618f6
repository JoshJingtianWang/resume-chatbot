Each histogram is labeled at the top with the corresponding season.\n\n- **x-axis**: Represents the profit per advertisement ($).\n- **y-axis**: Represents the count (or frequency) of occurrences.\n\nEach histogram shows a bar plot with the majority of the data concentrated around the lower end of the profit scale, close to $0. There are three vertical dashed lines of different colors (blue, yellow, and red) annotated as \"mean,\" indicating the average profit per advertisement for each season. The dashed lines are nearly overlapping, suggesting that the mean profit per advertisement is similar across all four seasons.\n\nThe distribution in each histogram appears to be skewed to the right, with a few instances of higher profit values extending beyond $25. The highest counts are observed close to $0 profit, indicating that most advertisements yield low or no profit.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-6-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
