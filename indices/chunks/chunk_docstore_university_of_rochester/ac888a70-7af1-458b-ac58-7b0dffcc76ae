The timeline spans from 2010 to 2018 and includes images of the dolphin's dorsal fin from four different years: 2010, 2012, 2016, and 2018. Each image shows the state of the dolphin's fin at these times, likely used to track changes and identify the individual dolphin over time. The background of each photo is water, indicating that the dolphin is in its natural aquatic environment. The purpose of the timeline and photos is to demonstrate the method of identifying and tracking the dolphin through the unique markings and shape of its dorsal fin over the years.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/deep learning project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/deep learning project report/figure-6-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
