The graph has two box plots, one for each target category labeled as \"0.0\" and \"1.0\" on the x-axis. The y-axis represents the TextBlob polarity, ranging from -1.0 to 1.0. \n\n- The box plot for target \"0.0\" is colored blue and shows a central tendency around 0.0, with the interquartile range (IQR) extending from approximately -0.25 to 0.25. There are several outliers above and below the whiskers.\n- The box plot for target \"1.0\" is colored orange and also centers around 0.0, with a slightly narrower IQR compared to the first box plot. Similarly, it has outliers extending beyond the whiskers.\n\nOverall, both categories exhibit similar distributions in terms of polarity, with a median around 0.0, indicating that the tweets generally have a neutral sentiment. The title of the graph is \"TextBlob Polarity of Tweets.\"", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-8-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
