The x-axis represents the number of epochs, ranging from 0 to 10, and the y-axis represents the loss values, ranging from 0.30 to 0.70.\n\nTwo lines are shown in the graph:\n1. A dotted line (labeled \"train\") representing the training loss.\n2. A solid line (labeled \"valid\") representing the validation loss.\n\nInitially, both the training and validation losses start at around 0.68. As the number of epochs increases, the training loss continually decreases, reaching approximately 0.34 by the 10th epoch. The validation loss also decreases initially, reaching its minimum around the 3rd epoch, and then it slightly increases and stabilizes at around 0.55 by the 10th epoch. This suggests that while the model is improving on the training set, it may be experiencing some overfitting, as indicated by the increase in validation loss after a certain point.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-12-13.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
