Each graph is labeled with a specific day number (Day 116, Day 117, Day 118, and Day 119), indicating the progression of days.\n\n- **Day 116:** The graph shows a notable increase in predicted cases as the number of deaths rises, with a sharp upward trend beginning around 100 deaths and continuing past 250 deaths.\n- **Day 117:** This graph exhibits a sharp spike in predicted cases at around 25 deaths, followed by a fluctuating pattern with a significant peak around 125 deaths, then decreasing towards 200 deaths.\n- **Day 118:** The graph shows a sharp increase in predicted cases at the beginning, followed by a steady rise in cases as deaths increase. There is a significant peak in predicted cases around 175 deaths.\n- **Day 119:** Similar to Day 117, this graph shows an initial sharp increase in predicted cases at lower death counts, followed by fluctuating peaks with a notable peak around 125 deaths.\n\nOverall, these graphs illustrate the varying relationship between predicted COVID-19 cases and deaths over a series of four days, highlighting the fluctuations and trends in the data as the days progress.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report/figure-4-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
