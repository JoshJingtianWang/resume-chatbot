The y-axis represents the profit per ad in dollars, ranging from 0 to 60. Each box plot displays the distribution of profits for each platform. \n\nKey observations:\n- The median profit per ad appears to be roughly similar across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, with YouTube showing a slightly higher median.\n- The interquartile range (IQR) is wider for YouTube, suggesting greater variability in profit per ad.\n- There are several outliers in the profit data for TikTok and YouTube, indicating some ads generated significantly higher profits.\n- Twitter has a moderate spread in the data, with fewer outliers compared to TikTok and YouTube.\n \nThe image suggests that while most platforms have similar median profits per ad, YouTube exhibits the highest variability and the potential for higher profits.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-14-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
