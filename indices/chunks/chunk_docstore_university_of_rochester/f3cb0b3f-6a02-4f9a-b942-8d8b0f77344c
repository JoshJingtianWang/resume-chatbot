The square is tilted slightly, making it appear as a diamond shape. The color gradient ranges from blue in the center to red at the corners, indicating variations in temperature. Blue areas generally represent cooler temperatures, while red areas signify hotter regions. The object seems to have a uniform temperature distribution with slightly higher temperatures at the corners. The background is predominantly dark blue, providing a contrast to the object.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
