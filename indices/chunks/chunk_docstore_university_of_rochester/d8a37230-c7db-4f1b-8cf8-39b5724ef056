The map uses a gradient color scale to represent the data, with darker shades indicating higher numbers of cases per capita and lighter shades indicating lower numbers. The color scale on the right side of the map ranges from light blue (representing fewer cases per capita) to dark blue (representing more cases per capita). \n\nOne county in the central-southern part of Ohio is shown in a much darker shade compared to the others, indicating a significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases per capita in that area. The rest of the counties are shaded in varying lighter tones, suggesting lower case numbers per capita. The geographical coordinates are provided along the axes, with the latitude ranging from approximately 38.5 to 42.5 and the longitude from approximately -85 to -81.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report/figure-2-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
