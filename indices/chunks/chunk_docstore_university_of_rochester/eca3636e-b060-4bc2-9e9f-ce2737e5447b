The new result (Fig. 5) showed improved clustering performance. Initial inspection showed more sensical clustering outcome.\n\nTable 1. Evaluation results. We used the Mean Average Precision at 5 (MAP@5) score as our evaluation metric (https://blog.paperspace.com/mean- average-precision/) (Score ranges from zero to one. For each query image, five predictions are allowed. The earlier the first correct guess, that higher the score). As seen in Table 1, our model performed poorly on identifying individual animals. We suspect this may be due to the fact that the vast majority of the subjects only have 1 test image available. The scarcity of data available for each individual may have resulted in this poor performance. However, our model had decent performance identifying the species of each animal, with the score improving after each adjustment we made. As the final result, we were able to correctly identify the species of half of the test subjects on the first guess.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nMonitoring of population trends can provide valuable information about marine mammal population\n\ndynamics, informing conservation and management decisions for ecologists (https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/csp2.611). To assess the population status and trends of marine mammals (whales and dolphins), marine biologists track individual animals over time. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071731474X?casa_token=2VsGw66RyW0A AAAA:Fohq3y5lvfQ5wMD_e3Eq9VkscVkHKUmpQQKbTnDiTGXZzj18AsN2F1kDCb1pxF2_GBUJ2hRXxA ) This kind of manual matching by the human eye can be time-intensive and sometimes inaccurate, and it limits the scope and reach of marine biology research (https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR10177).\n\nIn this project we used deep learning create a tool that identifies individual marine mammals.
