The x-axis represents the target variable, with 0 and 1 as its categories. The y-axis shows the TextBlob polarity scores, ranging from -1.00 to 1.00. The box plot for target 0 displays a median polarity score around 0.00, with an interquartile range roughly between -0.25 and 0.25. The box plot for target 1 shows a median around 0.25, with an interquartile range from approximately 0.00 to 0.50. Both box plots include several outliers.\n\nOn the right side, labeled \"VADER Compound Polarity of Tweets,\" there are also two box plots. The x-axis again represents the target variable (0 and 1), and the y-axis indicates the VADER compound polarity scores, also ranging from -1.00 to 1.00. The box plot for target 0 has a median polarity score around 0.25, with an interquartile range between 0.00 and 0.50. The box plot for target 1 has a median around 0.00, with an interquartile range from approximately -0.25 to 0.25. Both box plots show some outliers.\n\nThese visualizations demonstrate the distribution of polarity scores for tweets, with TextBlob and VADER providing different insights into the sentiment expressed in the tweets.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-8-9.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
