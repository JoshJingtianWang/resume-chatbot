Analysis\n\nFigure 1 shows the input IR beam, ground truth UV beam generated using PSOPS, and the predicted UV beams for two different beam orientations. The models were trained using 300 epochs on an RTX 3090 GPU and took approximately 12 and 28 min for the U-Net and cGAN, respectively, and 1.3 ms for the prediction of a single image in both cases. The mean squared error (MSE) normalized to the ground truth UV energy was less than 10\u20136 for the predictions shown in Fig. 1, and errors in predicted energy were of order 1%. Figure 2 shows the prediction errors for models retrained 25 times using random weight initializations, where large errors are observed in the low energy regime, but asymptote to a level of 1% or less at high energies. The low average errors of the L1+cGAN network suggest that averaging predictions from an ensemble of such networks may significantly reduce these errors. These results demonstrate the rapid and accurate prediction capability of the U-Net architecture and suggest that including the temporal profile of the laser pulse in the channel dimension of the network may provide high-resolution spatiotemporal predictions in real time for IFE-relevant laser facilities.\n\nThe authors acknowledge the data science practicum program (led by Ajay Anand and Cantay Caliskan) at the Goergen Institute for Data Science that facilitated this collaboration.
