However, since the use case of this research is to closely monitor natural disaster, and false negatives may lead to undesirable consequences, we thought it may be more important to focus on our model\u2019s ability to identify the positive class (i.e. the disaster tweets). Thus, we also looked at the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall scores.\n\nThe baseline results for our classification were:\n\nparameters:\n\nTFIDF_ngrams = (1,1), TFIDF_max_features = all, MultinomialNB_alpha = 1.0, fit_prior = True\n\naccuracy: 0.7845 f1: 0.6949\n\nThe results when we tuned towards high accuracy were:\n\nparameters:\n\nTFIDF_ngrams = (1,2), TFIDF_max_features = 5200, MultinomialNB_alpha = 0.40, fit_prior = True\n\naccuracy: 0.7933\n\nThe results when we tuned towards a high F1-score:\n\nparameters:\n\nTFIDF_ngrams = (1,2), TFIDF_max_features = 5200, MultinomialNB_alpha = 0.44, fit_prior = False\n\nf1: 0.7293\n\n4.5 Long-Short Term Memory Traditional neural networks (NNs) suffer from short-term memory and the vanishing gradient problem, which is especially apparent with longer data sequences. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks efficiently improve performance in this scenario by memorizing relevant information and then finding patterns. This makes LSTM great for NLP tasks, as it can memorize important information in sequential data.\n\nWe used Python\u2019s torchtext and spacy libraries to load the tweets and build vocabu- lary. We then used the BucketIterator from the torchtext library to group the tweets of similar lengths into batches. Having batches with similar length examples provides a lot of gain for recurrent NNs and transformers where padding will be minimal. We then used\n\nPage 9 of 12\n\nJake Brehm \u2022 Josh Wang\n\nUniversity of Rochester", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
