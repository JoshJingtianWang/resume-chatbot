It defines a vector \\( \\mathbf{f}^{(g)} \\), which is composed of elements \\( f_1^{(g)}, f_2^{(g)}, \\ldots, f_k^{(g)}, \\ldots, f_K^{(g)} \\) arranged in a column vector. Each element \\( f_k^{(g)} \\) is defined by a specific formula. \n\nThe formula for \\( f_k^{(g)} \\) involves a summation over a set \\( \\mathcal{X}_k \\). Specifically, it states that \\( f_k^{(g)} \\) equals the reciprocal of \\( p_k \\), multiplied by the summation of \\( x^{p_k} \\) for \\( x \\) in \\( \\mathcal{X}_k \\), all divided by the cardinality of \\( \\mathcal{X}_k \\). \n\nIn summary, the image shows a definition of a vector with elements that are computed using a specific mathematical operation involving summation, exponentiation, and normalization by the size of a set.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/deep learning project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/deep learning project report/figure-3-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
