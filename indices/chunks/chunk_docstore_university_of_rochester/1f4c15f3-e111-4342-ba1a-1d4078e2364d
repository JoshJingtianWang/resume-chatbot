The CV values indicate that the standard deviations across all platforms are all between 0-0.5 times as large as the mean. Based on our skew calculations, Face- book, Instagram, and Twitter having negative values indicates a left-skewed distribution of age. TikTok is close to having a symmetric distribution, and Youtube\u2019s skew value indicates a right-skewed distribution. TikTok had the youngest audience with a mean age of 20 and a relatively small standard deviation, while twitter ads reached the oldest audience with mean age of 38.\n\nQuestion 2\n\nThe CEO of the company believes that ads differ in effectiveness (measured in terms of profit, or ad revenue - ad cost) depending on the season. However, is his intuition correct?\n\nPart 2A: Visualize the data using four histograms (one from each season). On each plot, draw and label vertical lines for the mean, median, and 10% trimmed mean. Make sure to label the plots (title, axes, legend), and comment on trends you observe.\n\n# making profit variable ads$profit <- ads$adrevenue - ads$adcost\n\n# Calculate the optimal number of bins using Sturges' Rule n <- nrow(ads) k <- ceiling(log2(n)) + 1\n\n5\n\n# Should these lines be specific to each season? # https://statisticsglobe.com/add-different-line-each-facet-ggplot2-plot-r ggplot(ads, aes(x = profit)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = k) +\n\ngeom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(profit), color = \"mean\"),\n\nlinetype = \"dashed\") + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(profit),", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
