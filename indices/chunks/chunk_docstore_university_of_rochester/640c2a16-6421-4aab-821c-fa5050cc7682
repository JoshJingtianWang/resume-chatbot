The y-axis represents the word count, ranging from 0 to 30.\n\n- The box plot for tweets labeled \"0.0\" (in blue) shows a median word count of around 15. The interquartile range (IQR) extends from approximately 10 to 20 words, with the full range spanning from 0 to around 30 words.\n- The box plot for tweets labeled \"1.0\" (in orange) also shows a median word count of around 15. The IQR extends from approximately 10 to 18 words, with the full range spanning from 0 to around 28 words.\n\nBoth types of tweets have similar median word counts and ranges, suggesting that there is no significant difference in word count between the two types of tweets.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-6-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
