It has a similar color distribution to the \"Input Image\" but appears slightly clearer and more defined.\n\n3. **L1 Loss**: The third heat map, labeled \"L1 loss,\" shows an intermediate processed version of the data. The colors are similar to the previous images, but the details and clarity are improved compared to the \"Input Image.\"\n\n4. **L1 + CGAN**: The fourth heat map on the right, labeled \"L1 + CGAN,\" represents the final processed version of the data. This image appears to be the most refined and detailed, with clear color distinctions and defined edges, showcasing the highest clarity among the four images.\n\nThe color scales on the sides of each heat map range from blue (indicating lower values) to red (indicating higher values), with labels for the x-axis and color bars indicating the intensity or value range. The progression in the images suggests a process of data refinement or enhancement through different stages, likely using machine learning techniques.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-4.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
