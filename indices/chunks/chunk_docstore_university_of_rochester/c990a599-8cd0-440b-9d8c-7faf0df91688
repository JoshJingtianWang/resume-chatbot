Governor DeWine was one of the first state governors to recognize the threat posed by COVID-19 and take action before the epidemic swept Ohio [1]. At the beginning of the epidemic, DeWine required colleges and universities to take classes online, closed K-12 schools, and imposed a ban on mass gatherings [1]. As the situation evolved, DeWine continued to issue new bans and updates based on the epidemic\u2019s status, such as limiting the business hours of bars and restaurants, encouraging delivery services, and requiring companies to check the temperature\n\nC. Explore data\n\nBy analyzing the average normalized Jaccard similarity- based awareness values for various types of awareness topic variables, the present study reveals the top and bottom five topics that people in Ohio were most and least concerned about, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic. As de- picted in Figure 1, the top five topics that garnered the highest attention among Twitter users in Ohio were sports, entertain- ment, illness, core, and education. Conversely, the bottom five topics that received the least attention were health, ideology, health technology, politics democratic hate, and politics. The findings suggest that the Ohioans primarily focused on topics that directly impacted them during the pandemic. Furthermore, people in Ohio were more inclined towards political love rather than political hate during the pandemic.\n\nThe diagram presented in Figure 2 portrays the aggregated mean awareness value for counties in Ohio. The counties are arranged from left to right, with the county exhibiting the highest general Covid-19 awareness (core) positioned at the left, and the county with the lowest awareness of general Covid-19 awareness located at the right. The counties with the most elevated awareness of the epidemic in Ohio are Delaware,", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
