Laser near-field beams for two different input beam orientations. (a,e) Measured laser input IR beams, (b,f) ground truth laser output UV beam simulated using PSOPS, (c,g) UV beam predicted using U-Net trained with L1 loss, and (d,h) UV beam predicted using U-Net trained with L1 loss + cGAN. The MSE normalized to the ground truth UV energy was (c,d) 3.05 \u00d7 10-7, 1.78 \u00d7 10-7, and (g,h) 4.43 \u00d7 10-7, 2.28 \u00d7 10-7, respectively, with inference time of 1.3 ms for all cases. Energies were (a-d) 386 mJ, 1481 J, 1505 J, 1499 J, and (e-h) 426 mJ, 1840 J, 1871 J, 1858 J, respectively.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1e-6\n\n6\n\n40\n\nE S M d e z i l\n\na m r o N\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n%\n\nr o r r E y g r e n E V U\n\n20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n%\n\nr o r r E y g r e n E V U\n\nU-Net_L1 cGAN_L1\n\n1\n\n40\n\n0\n\nGround Truth UV Energy (J)\n\nL1\n\nL2\n\nL1+cGAN\n\nL2+cGAN\n\nL1\n\nL2\n\nL1+cGAN\n\nL2+cGAN\n\nFig. 2. (a) Normalized MSE and UV energy prediction errors for the four different models. Each model was retrained 25 times with different weight initializations taken from a gaussian random distribution. Each model iteration was tested on 20 bootstrapped test datasets and resulting errors were averaged to form a single point on each plot. (b) Average UV energy error for bootstrapped data for low ground truth UV energies. The shaded region shows the 95% confidence interval.\n\nReferences", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
