{"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "document", "Document"], "kwargs": {"page_content": "The image consists of five histograms representing the age distributions of users across five different social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube. \n\n1. **Facebook:**\n   - The histogram shows a relatively spread-out age distribution with a significant number of users in their 20s to early 40s. The distribution appears to be left-skewed (negatively skewed).\n\n2. **Instagram:**\n   - The age distribution is more concentrated, with most users in their 20s and early 30s. Similar to Facebook, it also shows a left-skewed distribution.\n\n3. **TikTok:**\n   - The age distribution is tightly clustered around the mean age of 20, indicating a younger audience. The distribution is nearly symmetric.\n\n4. **Twitter:**\n   - This platform has the oldest audience, with a noticeable concentration of users in their late 30s and early 40s. The distribution is left-skewed.\n\n5. **YouTube:**\n   - The age distribution is more spread out, with a substantial number of users ranging from their early 20s to late 30s. The distribution is right-skewed (positively skewed).\n\nThe caption further explains that Facebook and YouTube have the highest variance and standard deviations in ages. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for all platforms are between 0 and 0.5, indicating the standard deviations are less than half the size of their respective means. The skew calculations confirm that Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are left-skewed, TikTok is approximately symmetric, and YouTube is right-skewed.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-5-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
