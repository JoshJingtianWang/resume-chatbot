From this, we deduced that the shortest tweet text consists of a single word and four characters, while the lengthiest one has 89 words and 2,994 characters. On average, tweets have around 20 words. As for hashtags, the shortest comprises just one word and character, and the longest in a tweet has 16 words with 145 characters; however, the majority of tweets feature just one hashtag. Observing the average and median values of each columns, our dataset has a symmetrical distribution.\n\nII. DATA\n\nA. Overview\n\nThe dataset we use in this kaggle competition encom- passes tweets from politicians across seven Northern European nations: Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. The training set contains 407,223 tweets, complemented by a test set comprising 101,808 tweets, aggregating to a sum of 509,031 tweets. The train- ing dataset we used is structured with five columns, which in the tweet; the list of hashtags present are \u2019hashtags\u2019, \u2019full text\u2019, The text of tweet, inclusive emojis, htmls, hashtags; \u2019in reply to screen name\u2019, the Twitter screen name of the user the owner of the tweet is replying to; \u2019country user\u2019, indicating the tweet author\u2019s country; \u2019pol spec user\u2019, which characterizes the political alignment of the tweet\u2019s author, encompassing categories such as left, right, center, and in- dependent.\n\nB.
