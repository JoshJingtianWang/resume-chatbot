Therefore, after accounting for age ad cost significantly adds to the model and predicts profit.\n\n27\n\nQuestion 7\n\nSuppose you are given $100 to spend on advertising for this company. How would you spend it? Explain and interpret any additional analyses you want to do, and provide a detailed description of why you used the analyses you did. This portion should involve significant thought, perhaps partially based on the types of analysis you did earlier.
