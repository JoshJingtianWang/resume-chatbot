This attribute is not particularly useful when training models or performing any kind of analysis, as any particular id value has no relationship to any other value in its respective observation.\n\nkeyword , which is a particular keyword that is found in the text of the tweet. A value for this attribute is optional, and thus may be blank.\n\nPage 2 of 12\n\nJake Brehm \u2022 Josh Wang\n\nUniversity of Rochester\n\nlocation , which is the location that the tweet is sent from. Further analysis could determine that the geographical location that a tweet is sent from could be a signifi- cant factor in determining if a tweet is announcing a real disaster. Since not every tweet will have such metadata, a value for this attribute is optional, and thus may be blank. We decided against using this feature since it is highly inconsistent and mostly missing.\n\ntext , which is the text of a tweet. This is the main attribute that exploratory analysis\u2013i.e. word cloud and sentiment analysis\u2013and models will use.\n\ntarget , which denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. It is a binary value, so if a tweet is about a real disaster, its value will be 1 , and if a tweet is not about a real disaster, its value will be 0 . This attribute is located only in train.csv .\n\n3.3 Data Preprocessing\n\nOnce train.csv and test.csv have been combined into a single dataset, which was done by reading both csv files into a single pandas dataframe, we were able to begin exploring the data and seeing what kinds of data cleaning needed to be performed.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
