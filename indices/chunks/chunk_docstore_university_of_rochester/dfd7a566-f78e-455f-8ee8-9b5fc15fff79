The histogram has a horizontal axis labeled \"Profit/ad ($)\" and a vertical axis with no specific label indicating frequency. Most of the data is clustered near the lower end of the profit range, with a significant concentration around $0 to $5. There is also a single outlier around $50.\n\nThree different metrics are indicated in the histogram with vertical dashed lines:\n- The mean (average) profit per ad is represented by a blue dashed line at approximately $4.52.\n- The trimmed mean (mean calculated after removing extreme values) is shown with a red dashed line at approximately $3.37.\n- The median (middle value) is marked by a yellow dashed line at approximately $2.38.\n\nTo the right of the histogram, a legend identifies the colors and metrics:\n- Blue for the mean\n- Red for the trimmed mean\n- Yellow for the median\n\nIn summary, the histogram visualizes the distribution of profits per advertisement during the winter, highlighting key statistical measures such as the mean, median, and trimmed mean.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-9-6.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
