The plots are arranged in a 2x2 grid format.\n\n1. **Top Left (Marion County Training Data)**:\n   - The scatter plot shows the actual training data for Marion County's COVID-19 cases over approximately 120 days. The number of cases is plotted on the y-axis against the days on the x-axis. The data points show a significant spike in cases around day 100.\n\n2. **Top Right (Marion County Prediction V1, R2 = 0.98)**:\n   - This scatter plot depicts the predicted COVID-19 cases using a version 1 rule-based approach. The predicted cases are plotted on the y-axis against the days on the x-axis. The plot shows a sharp and exponential increase in predicted cases nearing the end of the 120-day period. The R-squared value is 0.98, indicating a high goodness of fit.\n\n3. **Bottom Left (Marion County Prediction V2, R2 = 0.91)**:\n   - This scatter plot shows another set of predictions using a version 2 rule-based approach. Similar to the other plots, it displays an exponential rise in predicted cases near day 100. The R-squared value, 0.91, suggests a good fit but lower than version 1.\n\n4. **Bottom Right (Marion County Prediction V3, R2 = 0.9963)**:\n   - The final scatter plot illustrates the predicted COVID-19 cases using a version 3 rule-based approach. Like the previous predictions, it shows a sharp increase in cases towards the end of the period. The R-squared value of 0.9963 indicates a very high goodness of fit, slightly better than version 1.\n\nThe plots collectively show the actual training data and three different predictions of COVID-19 cases in Marion County using non-machine learning rule-based approaches, each with varying degrees of accuracy as indicated by their respective R-squared values.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report/figure-4-9.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
