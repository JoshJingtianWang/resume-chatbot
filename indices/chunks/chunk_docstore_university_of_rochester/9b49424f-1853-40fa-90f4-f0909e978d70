Each of the ten subplots represents a distinct topic extracted, labeled as Topic 1 through Topic 10.\n\nEach subplot contains a list of words associated with the respective topic, with the words ranked by their significance or frequency within that topic. For example, in Topic 1, the most significant word is \"dkpol,\" followed by \"nye,\" \"mere,\" and so on. Similarly, Topic 2 has \"amp\" as the most significant word, followed by \"support,\" \"need,\" and others.\n\nThe y-axis of each subplot lists the words, while the x-axis represents an unspecified measure, likely the weight or significance score of each word within that topic. The bar lengths indicate the importance of each word in the context of its topic. This visualization helps in understanding the key terms and themes that characterize each of the ten topics identified by the NMF model.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_northern_europe_politician_tweet_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_northern_europe_politician_tweet_project_report/figure-3-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
