A score of -1 means that mostly words with negative connotations were used in the text, e.g. \u201dawful\u201d or \u201ddisgusting\u201d, whereas a score of 1 means that the string was mostly positive.\n\nVADER is another lexicon-based sentiment analyzer that gives a polarity score over four separate scores: positive, negative, neutral, and compound. Essentially, the input string is scored based on how positive, negative, and neutral its sentiment is, and these scores are returned separately; then, those three scores are normalized and returned to us as a compound score which ranges between -1 and 1. When comparing to results from TextBlob, we want to use VADER\u2019s compound score.\n\nWe used these two libraries to analyze the sentiment of both disaster and non-disaster\n\ntweets. The results are shown in Figure 4.\n\n(a) TextBlob polarity.\n\n(b) VADER compound polarity.\n\nFigure 4: Polarity of tweets.\n\nThe polarity boxplots illustrate that there is quite a significant difference in polarity and overall sentiment between tweets that refer to a real disaster and tweets that do not refer to a real disaster.\n\nAdditionally, we performed two-sample t-tests for the results of both the TextBlob and\n\nVADER analyses, shown in Table 1.\n\nMethod\n\nTest Statistic\n\np-value\n\nTextBlob VADER\n\n8.6716 5.2427e-18 19.326 4.2857e-81\n\nTable 1: t-test results for different sentiment analysis methods.\n\nPage 6 of 12\n\nJake Brehm \u2022 Josh Wang\n\nUniversity of Rochester", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
