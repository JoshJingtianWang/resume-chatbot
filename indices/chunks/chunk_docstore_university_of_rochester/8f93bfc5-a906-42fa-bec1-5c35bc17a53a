Some twitter features did contribute to prediction in the early iterations of our model building process, but we eventually found that the information the twitter data provided did not make up for the dimension- ality that it added to. The feature importance plot shows that \u201ddeaths\u201d and \u201dcounty\u201d are the most important features. In- terestingly, \u201dAccommodation and food services per capita\u201d is also an important feature. This may indicate that people working in those services play a factor in the spreading of COVID cases. In the future, we could engineer new features by shifting the \u201ddeaths\u201d column, since the onset of COVID is delayed, and deaths may not happen until several weeks after the infection of the COVID virus.\n\nIn the ensemble model ML approach, we divided a complex problem into 88 separate problems. This resulted in an R2 of 0.89. This is an improvement over the single model approach but in the end, it was limited by the sample size: after dividing by 88, each subset only had 30 rows. This approach is also computational expensive - it took around 2 hrs to train while the single model approach only took 10 minutes.\n\nIn the non-ML approach, we realized the importance of data visualization. By visualizing the data by county, we noticed the steady linear trend in the data, which greatly simplified our problem and yielded the best result (R2 = 0.996). This\n\napproach is, of course, not to be used outside of Kaggle challenges, as it relies on several assumptions we made that may not hold true in real life.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that combining data analysis and various prediction methodologies can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence the spread of COVID-19 in Ohio.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 Covid-19 pandemic in ohio. wikipedia.
