Each box plot consists of a rectangular box which represents the interquartile range (IQR) with a horizontal line inside the box indicating the median value. Whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the data, excluding outliers which are plotted as individual points outside the whiskers.\n\nSummary:\nThe box plot chart presents the distribution of data for four different categories (l1, l2, l1+GAN, l2+GAN). Each category shows variability in its values with medians, interquartile ranges, and outliers marked. The chart highlights differences in data spread and central tendency among these categories.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-13.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
