Each photo features the dorsal fin of a marine animal, likely a whale or a dolphin, emerging from the ocean water. The background in all images is consistent with a marine environment, showing varying degrees of ocean waves and water textures. The fins themselves display different shapes, sizes, and conditions, some with distinctive notches or markings. The images seem to be taken from a similar perspective, capturing the dorsal fins from the side or slightly behind, emphasizing their unique characteristics.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/deep learning project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/deep learning project report/figure-5-6.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
