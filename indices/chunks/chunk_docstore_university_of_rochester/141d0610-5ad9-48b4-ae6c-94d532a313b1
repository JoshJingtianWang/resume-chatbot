The x-axis represents the age of users, ranging from 10 to 60 years, and the y-axis represents the profit generated per ad, ranging from -20 to 60 dollars.\n\nDifferent colored dots represent data points for specific social media platforms:\n- Pink for Facebook\n- Yellow-green for Instagram\n- Teal for TikTok\n- Blue for Twitter\n- Purple for YouTube\n\nThe data points are scattered, with a notable concentration of data points around the younger age range (10 to 30 years). There are also some outliers, particularly in the profit range above 40 dollars. YouTube (purple dots) appears to have more dispersed data points, indicating a wider range of profit per ad across different ages.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-21-13.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
