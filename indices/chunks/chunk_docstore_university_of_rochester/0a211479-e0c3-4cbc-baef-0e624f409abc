Therefore, the marketing department is close to its advertising goals, however, they are not advertising nearly enough on Twitter to meet their goals.\n\nadd test statistic, add hypotheses\n\nPart 1C: For each social media platform, calculate the variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and skew of age, and visualize the distribution of age using an appropriate tool from descriptive statistics. Comment on any trends you see.\n\nCompared to the other platforms, it looks like TikTok has the youngest audience, with a mean age of 20 and a relatively small standard deviation. The customer base from YouTube ads had the greatest spread in age, with the greatest standard deviation and coefficient of variation. Customers from twitter ads had a higher mean age than customers from the other platforms, however there were also the least amount of customers (n=20) from twitter.\n\ncv <- function(x) {\n\nsd(x)/mean(x)\n\n} tapply(ads$age, ads$socialmedia, var)\n\n## Facebook Instagram 23.23202 ## 64.07424\n\nTikTok 10.18408\n\nTwitter 21.56579\n\nYouTube 92.60194\n\ntapply(ads$age, ads$socialmedia, sd)\n\n## Facebook Instagram TikTok ## 8.004639 4.819961 3.191251\n\nTwitter 4.643898\n\nYouTube 9.622990\n\ntapply(ads$age, ads$socialmedia, cv)\n\n## Facebook Instagram YouTube ## 0.2767795 0.1828768 0.1744160 0.1214091 0.3031199\n\nTikTok\n\nTwitter\n\n3\n\ntapply(ads$age, ads$socialmedia, skewness)\n\n## Instagram ## -0.33345445 -0.28353065\n\nFacebook", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
