The matrix comprises actual classes (True labels) on the vertical axis and predicted classes on the horizontal axis. \n\nThe values in the matrix are as follows:\n- **Center:**\n  - Correctly classified: 104,266\n  - Misclassified as Independent: 0\n  - Misclassified as Left: 219\n  - Misclassified as Right: 360\n- **Independent:**\n  - Correctly classified: 702\n  - Misclassified as Center: 0\n  - Misclassified as Left: 1\n  - Misclassified as Right: 0\n- **Left:**\n  - Correctly classified: 172,735\n  - Misclassified as Center: 858\n  - Misclassified as Independent: 7\n  - Misclassified as Right: 976\n- **Right:**\n  - Correctly classified: 126,603\n  - Misclassified as Center: 256\n  - Misclassified as Independent: 7\n  - Misclassified as Left: 233\n\nThe color intensity in the matrix cells represents the number of instances, with darker shades indicating higher values. This visual representation helps in understanding where the model is performing well and where it is making mistakes.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_northern_europe_politician_tweet_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_northern_europe_politician_tweet_project_report/figure-4-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
