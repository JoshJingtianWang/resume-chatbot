The x-axis represents the number of days, ranging from 0 to 120, while the y-axis represents the daily number of COVID cases, ranging from 0 to 14,000. The graph contains multiple lines, each representing different counties. \n\nInitially, all lines start at a low number of cases and remain relatively flat for the first 60 days. Around day 60, the number of daily COVID cases begins to rise sharply. By day 80, there is a noticeable increase in the number of cases, and this trend continues upward, with some counties experiencing a steeper rise than others. By day 120, several counties have reached daily case counts near or above 12,000, indicating a significant surge in COVID cases over the observed period. The lines are color-coded to differentiate between the counties, but specific counties are not labeled in the graph.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report/figure-3-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
