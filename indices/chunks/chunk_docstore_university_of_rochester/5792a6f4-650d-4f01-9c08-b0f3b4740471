Tweets coming out of California with keywords such as \u201dfire\u201d or \u201dsmoke\u201d could be given more weight to help more accurately detect forest fires. Similarly, tweets coming out of the central United States (termed Tornado Alley) with keywords such as \u201dstorm\u201d, \u201dtornado\u201d, or \u201dcloud\u201d could be given more weight when patrolling for tornadoes or other natural disasters.\n\nOnce an acceptable performance is achieved, we could deploy our model to monitor tweets in real time. This would, of course, benefit society in general, but more specifically the authorities that are trying to prevent and/or aid when disasters occur.\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nIn most aspects, the results are not exactly surprising. The number of words contained in a tweet does not correlate with whether or not a tweet is about a real disaster; however, the polarity that was calculated using sentiment analysis is correlated. Further exploratory analysis using word clouds verified that there is a very real and distinguishable theme to disaster tweets when compared to non-disaster tweets, and topic modeling confirmed that certain topics were more frequently discussed in disaster tweets. Naive Bayes classification performed better than LSTM, most likely due to the relatively small size of the dataset.\n\nOverall, this project taught us a lot about how to apply the data mining knowledge we\u2019ve acquired on a more real-life scenario. This is the type of problem that data mining and its associated analysis and machine learning techniques excel at, and it is also the type of problem that could benefit society as a whole.\n\nPage 11 of 12\n\nJake Brehm \u2022 Josh Wang\n\nUniversity of Rochester\n\nReferences", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
