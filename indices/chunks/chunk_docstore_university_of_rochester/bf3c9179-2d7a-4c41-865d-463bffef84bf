Another interpretation of this value is that 2.0812036% of the ads data fits the regressional model, and thus the statistical model is not very good at making predictions about profit given ad cost.\n\nHowever, looking at the scatter plot plot from 6B, the distribution of profit across ad cost may not necessarily be homoscedastic, which may mean linear regression is not the best model.\n\nPart F: Fit a linear regression to model the profit as a function of ad cost and age.
