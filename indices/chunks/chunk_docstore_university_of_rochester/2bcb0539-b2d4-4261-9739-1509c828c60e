Methodology\n\nLaser performance prediction in the long-pulse beamlines of OMEGA EP is currently done using the physics-based model PSOPS [4]. The 1053-nm-wavelength IR beam that is injected into an OMEGA EP beamline experiences gain in four passes through the main cavity amplifiers and two passes through the booster amplifiers, after which it is converted to 351 nm in KDP/DKDP frequency-conversion crystals. For a given input beam and pulse, different beam orientations and energy will produce different output beam spatial distributions and energy owing to the spatially dependent gain and intensity-dependent frequency-conversion process. Ground truth data were generated for different input beam orientations and energy using PSOPS and comprised 1360, 256 \u00d7 256-pixel input IR beam and corresponding output UV beam image pairs. The image pairs were randomly separated into training and test data in an 80%\u201320% split.\n\n3.
