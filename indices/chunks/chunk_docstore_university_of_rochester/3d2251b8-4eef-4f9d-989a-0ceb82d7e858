But we wondered if we could do better by incorporating the \u201ddeath\u201d variable as an additional predictor. We visualized the the relationship between our predicted COVID cases and deaths in the last few days of the test dataset (Figure 8). We found that the relationship is mostly linear as expected, but there is a sharp spike at the low death counts. That sharp spike turned out to be from the Marion County, which has lots of missing days near the end of the 120-day time range (Figure 8). The predicted COVID case counts in those days are too high given how few the deaths are in Marion County. So we lowered the predicted cases of the last few days of Marion County to that of the closest training data point, but strangely that lowered our R2 to 0.91. We then took the opposite extreme by raising the predicted cases to that of the last day of Marion County\u2019s predicted cases (the maximum). This resulted in an R2 of 0.996. The visualization of our attempts is visualized in Figure 9.\n\nFig. 8. COVID Cases vs Deaths in Last Few Days of Predicted Data.\n\nFig. 9.

RESULTS\n\nIn the data analysis, we discovered that Ohio residents were most concerned about sports, entertainment, illness, core, and education during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the least attention was given to health, ideology, health technology, pol- itics democratic hate, and politics. We identified the counties with the highest and lowest awareness of the pandemic in Ohio, which could have potentially influenced the spread of the virus.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
