The study further attempts to predict the number of Covid-19 cases in each county of Ohio, using both machine learning and non-machine learning methods. The dataset used in this study contains information on Covid-19 cases and deaths in Ohio, along with the awareness levels of Covid-19-related topics in all counties during the pandemic. The machine-learning approach yielded an R-squared value of 0.89308, utilizing ensemble model methods, while the non- machine-learning approach resulted in an R-squared value of 0.996.\n\nof employees daily [1]. The state also issued home orders, limited the number of people in public places, and encouraged everyone to wear masks [1]. Ohio worked with neighboring states to maintain the economy while reducing gatherings to prevent further infections [1].
