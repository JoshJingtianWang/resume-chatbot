By utilizing regular expression substitution, we were able to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the text column of the dataframe, with the exception of spaces (to allow for the tokenization of individual words)\n\nPage 3 of 12\n\nJake Brehm \u2022 Josh Wang\n\nUniversity of Rochester\n\nand quotation marks (to preserve certain grammatical features such as contractions). It was important that this was done after removing the HTML entities, as if it hadn\u2019t, the entities would never have been found and would be included in the later analysis, just without the non-alphanumeric characters.\n\nThen, we noticed that some observations contained one of a few canned phrases such\n\nas\n\n\u201dI liked a YouTube video\u201d\n\n\u201dI added a video to a YouTube playlist\u201d\n\nthat were not actually written by the author of the tweet. Thus, we removed these strings in order to uphold the integrity of our analyses.\n\nFinally, we converted all text to lower case and dropped all duplicates. The case conversion was done mostly in order to ensure that each word, which can be written in multiple ways, was treated by our analyses as a single word. This also benefits us by improving the aesthetics of our word cloud since it makes sure all words are in the same case, although this is quite subjective and overall a minor side effect.\n\n4 Exploratory Analysis and Modeling\n\nOne of the first things we tried to do was determine if there was some kind of association between word count and whether or not a tweet was announcing a real disaster.\n\nA visualization of this analysis can be found in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: Word count analysis between types of tweets.\n\nThe boxplot clearly shows that there was no association between the number of words in a tweet and whether or not the tweet was about a real disaster.\n\nPage 4 of 12\n\nJake Brehm \u2022 Josh Wang\n\nUniversity of Rochester\n\n4.1 Word Cloud", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
