The x-axis indicates the profit per ad in dollars, ranging from 0 to over 40. The y-axis shows the frequency (number of occurrences) corresponding to each profit value.\n\nThe histogram is characterized by a high frequency of low profit values, with the highest bar around zero. There are three vertical dashed lines in different colors representing various statistical metrics:\n\n1. **Mean (blue dashed line)**: \\( \\bar{x} = 6.022336 \\)\n2. **Trimmed Mean (red dashed line)**: \\( \\bar{x}_{10} = 4.89931 \\)\n3. **Median (orange dashed line)**: \\( \\tilde{x} = 3.78 \\)\n\nThese metrics are annotated on the histogram along with a legend on the right to indicate which color corresponds to each metric. The histogram suggests that the majority of the profits per ad are clustered around lower values, with fewer instances of higher profits.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-8-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
