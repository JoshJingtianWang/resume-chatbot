The x-axis represents the ad cost ranging from $0 to $15, and the y-axis represents the profit per ad ranging from $0 to $60. \n\nEach dot on the plot represents a data point, color-coded according to the social media platform it corresponds to. The legend indicates the colors assigned to each platform:\n- Facebook: Red\n- Instagram: Olive Green\n- TikTok: Teal\n- Twitter: Light Blue\n- YouTube: Purple\n\nFrom the scatter plot, it can be observed that:\n- Most of the data points are clustered in the lower range of the ad cost and profit, particularly between $0 and $10 for ad cost and $0 and $20 for profit per ad.\n- YouTube (represented by purple dots) has a wider spread in both ad cost and profit per ad, with some points showing higher profits at higher ad costs.\n- Other platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter have a more concentrated distribution of points within the lower ranges of ad cost and profit per ad.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-22-14.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
