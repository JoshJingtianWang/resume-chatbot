Each thermal map is color-coded with a corresponding scale bar to the right, indicating the intensity of some quantity (likely related to energy or heat, given the units J/cm\u00b2 and the color scales).\n\n### First Row:\n- **(a) Input Image**: Shows an initial thermal image with a predominantly blue background and a rectangular region with varying color intensities from blue to red.\n- **(b) Ground Truth**: Displays the actual thermal image with more detailed variations within the rectangular region, showcasing fine details in color changes.\n- **(c) L1 Loss**: Depicts a thermal image reconstructed using L1 loss, with noticeable details and color variations similar to the Ground Truth but with some differences.\n- **(d) L1 + cGAN**: Represents a thermal image reconstructed using a combination of L1 loss and a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), showing enhanced detail and color fidelity closer to the Ground Truth.\n\n### Second Row:\n- **(e) Input Image**: Similar to the first row, displaying an initial thermal image with a rotated rectangular region.\n- **(f) Ground Truth**: Shows the actual thermal image with detailed variations within the rotated rectangular region.\n- **(g) L1 Loss**: Illustrates the reconstructed thermal image using L1 loss, maintaining some similarity with the Ground Truth but with noticeable deviations.\n- **(h) L1 + cGAN**: Exhibits the thermal image reconstructed using L1 loss combined with cGAN, yielding results that are visually closer to the Ground Truth in terms of detail and color intensity.\n\nOverall, the image compares the effectiveness of different reconstruction methods (L1 loss and L1 + cGAN) against the Ground Truth for thermal images, highlighting the superior performance of the combined approach (L1 + cGAN) in preserving details and color accuracy.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-1.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
