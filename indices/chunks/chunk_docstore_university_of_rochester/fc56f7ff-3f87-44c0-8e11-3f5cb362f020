Deep learning systems no longer require feature extraction methods' complex programming requirements. Instead, exposure to large amounts of data allows these algorithms to learn traits that allow them to discriminate against individuals [5]. These methods were mainly developed outside ecology, first in computer image recognition [6] and, more recently, in the security and social media industry [4]. Modern deep-learning systems consistently outperform feature engineering methods when they access large amounts of data [7, 8]. Many ecologists have recently begun using deep learning systems to identify species and individual animals with great success [9, 10]. Table 1 summarizes ecologists' animal reidentification studies, methodologies, and model performance.\n\nTable 1 Past works on animal reidentification Year Methodology Animal Sperm Whale 1990 Database similarity Humpback Whale 1990 Database similarity Grey Seal Sperm Whale Cheetah Whale/Dolphin Marbled Salamander Whale Shark Elephant\n\nAcc.
