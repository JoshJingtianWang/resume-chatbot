In the context of this research, we can use a topic model to determine which topics were most frequently discussed in non-disaster tweets and compare those results to the topics that were found in disaster tweets.\n\nTo perform this analysis in Python, stop words were removed from the text using spacy , and the text was then lemmatized using the same library. We then performed tokenization using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), which is a numerical statistic that is meant to illustrate the importance of an individual word in a text. Then, we used three different dimensional reduction approaches to obtain topics from the tweets:\n\n1. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) from the sklearn library\n\n2. Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) from the gensim library\n\n3. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) from the sklearn library\n\nAfter some testing, we found that NMF generated the most interpretable results. Figure\n\n5 compares the results of the topic modeling for both non-disaster and disaster tweets.\n\nFigure 5: Results of topic modeling.\n\nWe can see that disaster-related topics: \u201ccalifornia wildfire\u201d and \u201cburn building\u201d, are more highly represented in disaster tweets, whereas random topics without discernible meanings: \u201cunknown1\u201d, \u201cunknown2\u201d and \u201cloud scream\u201d are more highly represented in non-disaster tweets.\n\nPage 7 of 12\n\nJake Brehm \u2022 Josh Wang\n\nUniversity of Rochester", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
