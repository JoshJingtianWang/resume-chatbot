The x-axis represents the epochs, ranging from 0 to 10, while the y-axis represents the accuracy, ranging from 0.6 to 0.9.\n\nTwo lines are shown in the graph:\n1. A dotted line labeled \"train,\" which represents the training accuracy of the model.\n2. A solid line labeled \"valid,\" indicating the validation accuracy of the model.\n\nThe training accuracy increases sharply during the initial epochs, then continues to rise more gradually, reaching its peak at approximately 0.88 by the 10th epoch. The validation accuracy also increases initially but stabilizes and fluctuates slightly around 0.75 to 0.78 after the 5th epoch. This suggests that while the model performs better on the training data, its performance on the validation data plateaus, indicating a potential overfitting scenario.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-12-14.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
