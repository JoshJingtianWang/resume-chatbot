The bar transitions smoothly from blue at the bottom to red at the top. There are numerical labels along the right side of the bar at intervals: 0 at the bottom, 0.5 slightly above the bottom, 1 in the middle, and 1.5 near the top. The colors represent a range of values, with blue indicating lower values and red indicating higher values. This type of color bar is typically used to illustrate the range of data values in a heat map or similar graphical representation.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
