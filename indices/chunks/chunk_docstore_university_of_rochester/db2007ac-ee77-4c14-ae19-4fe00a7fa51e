Each dot represents a data point. The majority of the data points are clustered near the lower end of both axes, specifically between 0 to 5 on the x-axis and from around -10 to 10 on the y-axis. There are a few outliers, with one data point significantly above 100 on the y-axis and another above 50. The overall trend indicates that higher advertising costs do not necessarily correlate with higher profits per dollar, as most data points are concentrated near the origin.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-31-21.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
