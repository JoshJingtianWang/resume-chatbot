Each group is represented by a different color: blue, orange, green, and red. The vertical axis ranges from -40 to 40, while the horizontal axis is labeled with four categories, although the full labels are not visible.\n\nEach box plot displays the distribution of data within each group:\n- The middle line in each box represents the median.\n- The boxes indicate the interquartile range (IQR), showing the middle 50% of the data.\n- The \"whiskers\" extend to indicate the range of the data within 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles.\n- Outliers are marked as individual points beyond the whiskers.\n\nThe graph appears to compare the distributions of these four groups, illustrating differences in medians, variability, and the presence of outliers.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-14.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
