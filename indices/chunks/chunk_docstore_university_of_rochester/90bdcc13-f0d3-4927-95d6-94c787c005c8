This dataset was created by the company Appen (formerly figure-eight) and originally shared on their Data For Everyone website here.\n\nSince the dataset comes from a Kaggle competition, it has already been cleaned, at least to a reasonable extent. However, that does not mean that it is immediately ready for analysis or training purposes; some additional data preprocessing needed to be performed before we could train any model or perform any analysis.\n\n3.2 Data Format\n\nThe data was provided in two parts: train.csv and test.csv . As denoted by their appropriately chosen names, train.csv is intended to be the data set used for training any models, while test.csv was intended to be used to test those models.\n\nWe decided to combine these two datasets into one for exploratory visualizations such as word cloud and sentiment analysis. This allowed us to get a closer look at a larger data set instead of just being limited to training data, and potentially catch any extra data cleaning that we must perform. Once combined, the 7613 observations in the training data set and the 3263 rows in the testing data set became 10876 tweet observations in total.\n\nFor supervised learning models, we split the train.csv into 5 folds using StratifiedK- Fold for cross-validation. The test.csv was not used for supervised learning since no class label was provided.\n\nThe attributes of these data sets are as follows:", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
