The collage is divided into three horizontal rows, each containing six images.\n\n1. **Top Row**: This row features six close-up images of dorsal fins of dolphins. Each fin has distinct characteristics, such as shape, notches, or markings, which are likely used for identification purposes.\n\n2. **Middle Row**: The second row presents six images of dolphins swimming in the ocean. The dolphins are partially submerged, and their dorsal fins are visible above the water. These images capture the dolphins in motion, with water splashing around them.\n\n3. **Bottom Row**: The third row also contains six images of dolphins in the ocean, similar to the middle row. The dolphins are seen from a distance, and their dorsal fins are visible above the water surface. These images are less detailed compared to the close-ups in the top row.\n\nThe collage illustrates the clustering of dolphin images based on the visual characteristics of their dorsal fins, likely for identification or research purposes. The baseline model appears to categorize the images based on similarities in the dorsal fins' features.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/deep learning project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/deep learning project report/figure-4-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
