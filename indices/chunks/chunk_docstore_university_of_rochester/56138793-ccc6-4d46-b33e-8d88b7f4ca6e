The y-axis represents the frequency or proportion of each topic within the targets, ranging from 0.0000 to 0.0175.\n\nThe topics are color-coded and identified in the legend on the right side of the chart:\n- unknown1 (blue)\n- california wildfire (orange)\n- unknown2 (green)\n- loud scream (red)\n- burn building (purple)\n\nIn target category \"0,\" the topic \"unknown1\" has the highest frequency, followed by \"unknown2,\" \"california wildfire,\" \"burn building,\" and \"loud scream,\" in descending order. Similarly, in target category \"1,\" \"unknown1\" again has the highest frequency, followed by \"california wildfire,\" \"burn building,\" \"loud scream,\" and \"unknown2,\" in descending order.\n\nThe chart visually represents how different topics are distributed across the two target categories, with \"unknown1\" being the most prominent topic in both targets.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-9-10.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
