The first box plot shows data distributions for four different methods: L1, L2, L1+cGAN, and L2+cGAN. The y-axis scale is set to \\( 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\).\n\nThe second box plot displays the UV Energy Error (%) for the same four methods: L1, L2, L1+cGAN, and L2+cGAN. Each method\u2019s error distribution is represented by a box and whisker plot, indicating the spread and central tendency of the data.\n\n(b) The right side of the image presents a line graph showing the UV Energy Error (%) as a function of Ground Truth UV Energy (J). Two methods are compared in this graph: U_Net_L1 and cGAN_L1. The U_Net_L1 method is represented by a blue line and the cGAN_L1 method by an orange line. Shaded regions around the lines indicate the variance or confidence intervals for the error measurements.\n\nOverall, the image seems to compare the performance of various methodologies in terms of UV Energy Error, using both box plots to show distribution and a line graph to depict the relationship with ground truth UV energy.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-12.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
