The panels are labeled as follows:\n\n1. **Input Image**: This panel displays a predominantly blue square with a thin border of orange and yellow, indicating lower intensity in the center and higher intensity along the edges.\n\n2. **Ground Truth**: This panel shows a square with a variety of colors, primarily in the orange and yellow spectrum, indicating higher intensity within the square. There is a noticeable pattern of spots and irregularities.\n\n3. **L1 Loss**: This panel is similar to the \"Ground Truth\" panel, with a predominantly orange and yellow color scheme, suggesting higher intensity values. The pattern of spots and irregularities is also present here.\n\n4. **L1 + VGGN**: This panel is also similar to the \"Ground Truth\" and \"L1 Loss\" panels, with a mixture of orange and yellow colors indicating higher intensity. The pattern of spots and irregularities is consistent with the previous two panels.\n\nThe color bar on the right side of each panel ranges from blue (low intensity) to red (high intensity), providing a scale for the intensity values represented in the images. Each panel also includes axes labels with units, specifically x [cm] and y [cm^2].", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
