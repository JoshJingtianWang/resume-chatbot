The graphs compare the training set (dotted line) and the validation set (solid line):\n\n1. **(a) Loss of validation set**: This graph shows the loss metric over the epochs. The y-axis represents the loss values, and the x-axis represents the number of epochs. The loss for both the training and validation sets decreases over time, with the training loss consistently lower than the validation loss.\n\n2. **(b) Accuracy of validation set**: This graph depicts the accuracy metric over the epochs. The y-axis represents the accuracy values, and the x-axis represents the number of epochs. The accuracy for both sets increases over time, with the training accuracy consistently higher than the validation accuracy.\n\n3. **(c) F1-score of validation set**: This graph illustrates the F1-score over the epochs. The y-axis represents the F1-score values, and the x-axis represents the number of epochs. The F1-score for both sets increases over time, with the training F1-score consistently higher than the validation F1-score.\n\nIn all three graphs, the model performance on the training set is better than on the validation set, as indicated by the respective metrics.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-12-12.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
