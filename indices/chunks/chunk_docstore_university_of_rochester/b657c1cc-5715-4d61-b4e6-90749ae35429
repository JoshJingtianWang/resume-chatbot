It is divided into two main sets, each representing different input beam orientations.\n\n1. **First Set (a-d)**:\n   - **(a)** Displays the measured input infrared (IR) beam.\n   - **(b)** Shows the ground truth ultraviolet (UV) beam output simulated using PSOPS.\n   - **(c)** Depicts the UV beam predicted using a U-Net model trained with L1 loss.\n   - **(d)** Illustrates the UV beam predicted using a U-Net model trained with L1 loss combined with a conditional GAN (cGAN).\n\n2. **Second Set (e-h)**:\n   - **(e)** Displays another measured input IR beam.\n   - **(f)** Shows the ground truth UV beam output simulated using PSOPS.\n   - **(g)** Depicts the UV beam predicted using a U-Net model trained with L1 loss.\n   - **(h)** Illustrates the UV beam predicted using a U-Net model trained with L1 loss combined with a cGAN.\n\nThe provided caption details the Mean Square Error (MSE) normalized to the ground truth UV energy for the predicted beams: \n- (c) 3.05 \u00d7 10^-7\n- (d) 1.78 \u00d7 10^-7\n- (g) 4.43 \u00d7 10^-7\n- (h) 2.28 \u00d7 10^-7\n\nThe inference time for all cases is 1.3 milliseconds. Additionally, the energies for the beams are noted as follows:\n- (a) 386 mJ\n- (b) 1481 J\n- (c) 1505 J\n- (d) 1499 J\n- (e) 426 mJ\n- (f) 1840 J\n- (g) 1871 J\n- (h) 1858 J\n\nThe image also includes a scale indicating energy in joules per square centimeter (J/cm\u00b2).", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-11.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
