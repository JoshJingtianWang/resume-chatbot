The sequence of steps is as follows:\n\n1. **Test Images**: The process begins with input test images.\n2. **EffNet**: The test images are passed through a neural network model referred to as EffNet. \n   - The model loads trained weights and biases.\n3. **GeM Pooling**: The output of the EffNet is processed using GeM (Generalized Mean) Pooling.\n4. **Embeddings**: The pooled data is converted into embeddings.\n5. **Predict via trained KNN**: Finally, the embeddings are used for prediction using a trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.\n\nEach step is represented by a blue box with arrows indicating the flow of data from one step to the next.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/deep learning project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/deep learning project report/figure-4-4.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
