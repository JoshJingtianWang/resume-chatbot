Introduction\n\nMachine-learning (ML) methods will likely be required in broadband and multifrequency laser systems relevant to inertial fusion energy (IFE) to achieve the necessary power balance through rapid feedback control, expedite alignment, improve laser performance predictions, and support post-shot data analysis. These laser systems will rapidly generate large amounts of data that must be strategically selected to maintain model calibration and identify unsafe operating conditions [1]. In order to achieve real-time optimization in an IFE laser facility, accurate laser predictive models must be developed that support the higher repetition rates. We explore the use of generative ML models to perform rapid predictions of laser system output beam spatial distributions with the goal of identifying ML architectures that can be adapted to next-generation IFE-relevant laser systems. We trained a U-Net model [2] using (1) a reconstruction loss alone (L1 or L2) and (2) in combination with a discriminator in a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) [3] to predict the output UV beam of the OMEGA EP Laser System.\n\n2.
