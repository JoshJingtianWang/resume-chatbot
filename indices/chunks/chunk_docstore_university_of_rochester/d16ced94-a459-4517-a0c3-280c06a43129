Counties with higher death rates are shown in darker shades of red, while those with lower rates are in lighter shades. The color bar on the right provides a scale for interpreting the colors, with values ranging from 0.00000 to 0.00012. The map includes latitude and longitude markers along its borders, showing a geographical range from approximately 38.5 to 42.5 degrees latitude and -85 to -81 degrees longitude.
