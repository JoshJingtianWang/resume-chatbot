The model is trained and its weights and biases are saved.\n3. **GeM Pooling**: The output from EffNet undergoes \"GeM Pooling\" (Generalized Mean Pooling), which is a pooling operation used to aggregate features.\n4. **Embeddings**: The pooled features are converted into \"Embeddings,\" which are vector representations of the images.\n5. **ArcFace Loss**: The embeddings are further processed using \"ArcFace Loss,\" a technique used for face recognition and embedding learning.\n6. **KNN**: Finally, the embeddings are utilized in a \"KNN\" (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm for nearest neighbor search, classification, or other purposes.\n\nThe flowchart ensures a structured approach to training an image recognition model and generating useful image embeddings for further analysis or classification tasks.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/deep learning project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/deep learning project report/figure-3-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
