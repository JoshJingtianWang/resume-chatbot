This conference will be led by Mark and we hope to see positive responses for our work.\n\nThe UR-LLE team can decide on which model can be useful for their laser scientists and deploy the model for active use to make better strategies. \n\nPage 29\n\nPyTorch vs TensorFlow : Converting the cGAN code to PyTorch for better comparison.\n\nPage 30\n\nThank you!\n\nPage  31\n\nQuestions?\n\nPage  32", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_presentation.pptx"}, "type": "Document"}}
