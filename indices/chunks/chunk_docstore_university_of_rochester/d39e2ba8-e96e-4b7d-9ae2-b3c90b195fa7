These include race-related topics during the initial stages, gender-related topics during the mid-term, and sports-related topics towards the end of the epidemic. Furthermore, sports-related topics maintained a considerable amount of attention during the early stage of the epidemic. And topics related to illness and general Covid-19 awareness maintained a high level of discussion during the middle and late stages of the epidemic.\n\nFig. 5. The evolution of awareness levels for topics.\n\nIII. METHODS\n\nA. Machine Learning Approach\n\n1) Single Model Approach: We used an Auto ML package called Pycaret to build the machine learning model [2]. Pycaret automates the process of pre-processing pipeline building, model selection, and model hyperparameter tuning. However, our initial R2 result was poor: only 0.80. We then decided to incorporate external data to enrich our features. We downloaded employment data, health insurance data, and land area by county data from census.gov [3]. We engineered the following new features from the external datasets:\n\nRetail trade employee count (total and per capita) - Accommodation and food services employee count (total\n\nand per capita)\n\nProfessional, scientific, and technical services employee\n\ncount (total and per capita)\n\nEducational services employee count (total and per capita) - Health care and social assistance employee count (total\n\nand per capita)\n\nPopulation density (calculated using total population / land\n\narea)\n\nPercent uninsured We also noticed that removing the twitter data improved our", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
