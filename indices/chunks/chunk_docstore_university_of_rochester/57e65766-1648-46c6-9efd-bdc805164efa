While word clouds aren\u2019t normally useful for quantifiable analysis due to the lack of a size scale and the arbitrary nature of the word placement, it is a great way to illustrate the general sentiment or theme of a text.\n\nIn the context of this problem, generating a word cloud from the entire data set might not be very meaningful, as it would only depict the most frequent words\u2013a good word cloud should also convey some theme or tell some kind of story through the most frequent words as well.\n\nThat said, as alluded to previously, word clouds can be useful tools to summarize the views of an audience or theme of a text. Thus, we split the training data set (i.e. data that has already has a target column) into two dataframes: tweets concerning real disaster, and tweets that are not about real disasters. Two separate word clouds were then generated, one for each data frame, and these visuals can be seen in Figure 3.\n\n(a) Tweets not about real disasters.\n\n(b) Tweets about real disasters.\n\nFigure 3: Word clouds of tweets.\n\nAs demonstrated by the two word clouds, the frequent words in real disaster tweets are generally more negative, intense, and/or vulgar; comparatively, tweets that aren\u2019t about real disasters seem to have words that generally have more of a positive connotation. It is, however, clear as to how those tweets could be misinterpreted as announcements of real disasters. Many of the words in Figure 3(a) are words that have multiple meanings, or are used as slang terminology. For example, \u201dfire\u201d is a word that, in today\u2019s slang, could be a synonym for \u201dcool\u201d\u2013however, this is a word that also obviously could be describing a real disaster.
