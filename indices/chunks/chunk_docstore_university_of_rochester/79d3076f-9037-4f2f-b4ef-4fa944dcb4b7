Each point on the scatter plot represents a data point, color-coded by the social media platform. The legend indicates the color corresponding to each platform: Facebook (red), Instagram (olive), TikTok (cyan), Twitter (blue), and YouTube (magenta). The plot shows a spread of points, with YouTube (magenta) appearing to have higher advertising costs compared to other platforms. The profit values appear to be scattered across a range from 0 to -10, with no clear linear relationship visible between ad cost and profit.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-32-22.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
