Make sure to label the plot (title, axes, legend), and comment on trends you observe.\n\nSome trends that can be seen here are that tiktok has the highest mobile phone usage out of any of the other social media platforms, and yet does not have a much different range of profits than the other platforms. Additionally, YouTube has some of the highest profits and seems to be the only platform that has more computer users than mobile users.\n\n# histogram option ggplot(ads, aes(x = profit)) + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(mobile ~\n\nsocialmedia)\n\n## \u2018stat_bin()\u2018 using \u2018bins = 30\u2018.
