Each topic is represented by a different colored line, with a total of 21 topics listed in the legend on the right side of the graph. The x-axis represents the days, ranging from 0 to 120, while the y-axis represents the normalized Jaccard index values, which measure the awareness levels.\n\nThe graph shows fluctuating awareness levels for each topic over the 120-day period. Most topics have relatively low and consistent awareness levels, with occasional spikes. Notably, there are significant peaks in awareness for specific topics around day 20 and day 60. The topic represented by the green line shows a pronounced spike around day 20, reaching above 0.30 on the y-axis. Another topic, represented by the orange line, peaks around day 60, exceeding 0.10.\n\nOverall, the graph provides a detailed visualization of how the awareness levels for different topics evolve over time, highlighting specific days when certain topics saw notable increases in awareness.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report/figure-2-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
