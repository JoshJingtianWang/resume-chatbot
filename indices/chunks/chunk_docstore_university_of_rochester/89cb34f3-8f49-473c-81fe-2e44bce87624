The size of the training data could be increased, especially the number of images per individual animal. This\n\nmay help improve the model\u2019s performance on identifying individual animals.\n\n2. Timestamps on each image. Assuming query images are always images taken at a later time compared to\n\ntraining images (Fig 6), we could incorporate sequential networks such as LSTM into our model.\n\nFigure 6. Sequential images showing the progressive healing of a wound on a dolphin. 3. Background removal. Our model could benefit from more sophisticated background removal techniques to\n\nfurther eliminate background influence.\n\n4. Classification. Instead of using image retrieval, we could attempt directly classify the images. The downside of\n\nthis approach is that we would need to retrain the model each time a no individual is added to the training data.\n\nIt is our hope that this project contributes to the effort to overcome increasing human impacts\n\non oceans, providing a critical tool for conservation science.\n\nReferences\n\n1. reidentification from camera trap data.\"\u202fMethods in Ecology and Evolution\u202f10.4 (2019): 461-470. 2. retrieval: A review of recent trends.\"\u202fCogent Engineering\u202f8.1 (2021): 1927469. 3.
