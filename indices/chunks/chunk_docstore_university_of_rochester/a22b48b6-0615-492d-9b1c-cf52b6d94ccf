The y-axis represents the count of instances, while the x-axis represents the target classes.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-10-11.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
