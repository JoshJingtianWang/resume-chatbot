The plot is colored, with a gradient scale on the right side ranging from blue to red, indicating different values of the measured quantity.\n2. The highest values are shown in red, while the lowest are in blue.\n3. The rectangular shape in the center has higher values along the edges, especially the top right corner, which is depicted in red, indicating the highest concentration or intensity in that area.\n4. The axes are labeled with \"x [cm]\" and \"y [cm]\", suggesting the measurements are in centimeters and the plot covers a range from -20 cm to 20 cm on both axes.\n5. The color scale to the right of the plot is marked from 0 to 1, with an annotation of \"x 10^3\", suggesting that the actual values range from 0 to 1000.\n\nOverall, the image represents a spatial distribution of a certain parameter over a rectangular region, with significant variations along the edges.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
