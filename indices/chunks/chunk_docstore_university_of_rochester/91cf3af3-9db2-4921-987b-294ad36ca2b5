The square is rotated slightly, with its corners pointing towards the top-left and bottom-right of the image. The colors range from blue to yellow, indicating different temperature levels or intensities. The corners of the square are highlighted in yellow and red, suggesting higher temperatures or intensities in these areas, while the central region is predominantly blue, indicating cooler temperatures or lower intensities. The background is uniformly dark blue, providing a contrast to the square object.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/GAN_capstone_project_report/figure-2-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
