We obtained a multi-species dataset consisting of dorsal fins and lateral body views of whales and dolphins, built by 28 research institutions. Using deep learning, we can automate this photo-ID process and identify animals by their unique and often subtle characteristics of their natural markings. We aimed to use an image retrieval technique to find the top similar images to the query image. The image retrieval task is similar to Google\u2019s Reverse Image Search, where we extract features from the query image and perform matching based on the extracted vectors.\n\nThis article is organized as follows: We first provide a brief description of our related work, including the main techniques developed by pioneers in the field, notable studies, and their characteristics. Then, the methods used to develop our model are described, and empirical results on the model's performance are presented. In the end, conclusions are drawn based on the findings.\n\n2.\n\nRelated Work\n\nFor decades before the advent of deep learning, computer vision was involved ins approaches to standardizing animal reidentification statistical analysis. Feature engineering was the most widely used method, where algorithms were developed and implemented with a focus solely on predefined features to distinguish individuals. The main limitation of this approach relates to its impracticality [3]. Feature engineering requires programming experience and a good knowledge of biology to identify relevant traits. It also lacks generality when feature recognition algorithms developed for one species are unlikely to serve others.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/deep learning project report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
