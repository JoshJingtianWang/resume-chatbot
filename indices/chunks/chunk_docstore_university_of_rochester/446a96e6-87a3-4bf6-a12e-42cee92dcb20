{"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "document", "Document"], "kwargs": {"page_content": "The image is a box plot chart that compares the profit distributions across different social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube) based on two different modes of access: computer (represented in red) and mobile (represented in blue). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Facebook:** The profit distributions for computer and mobile users are quite similar, with the median values close to each other. The interquartile ranges (IQR) are also comparable, although the computer has a slightly wider range.\n- **Instagram:** Profits for mobile users are generally higher than for computer users. The mobile median is higher, and the IQR is wider for mobile, indicating a larger spread of profits.\n- **TikTok:** Mobile users show higher and more varied profits compared to computer users. The median profit for mobile is significantly higher, and there are more outliers present.\n- **Twitter:** Both distributions are similar in terms of median and IQR, though mobile has a slightly higher median.\n- **YouTube:** Computer users show higher profits compared to mobile users. The median profit is higher for computer users, and the IQR is wider, indicating greater variability. There are also more outliers present for computer users.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are observable differences in profits between computer and mobile users across different social media platforms. TikTok and Instagram show notably higher profits for mobile users, while YouTube shows higher profits for computer users. Facebook and Twitter have similar profit distributions for both access modes. These differences suggest that the mode of access (computer vs. mobile) does impact average profits on these social network platforms at the \u03b1 = 0.05 significance level. Further statistical analysis would be needed to confirm these observations.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-20-12.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
