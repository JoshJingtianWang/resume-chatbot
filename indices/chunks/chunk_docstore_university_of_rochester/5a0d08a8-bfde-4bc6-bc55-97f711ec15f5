The horizontal axis represents the profit per ad ($), ranging from 0 to over 50 dollars, while the vertical axis represents the frequency of occurrences.\n\nThree vertical dashed lines are overlaid on the histogram, each indicating a different statistical measure of the data:\n- The blue dashed line represents the mean (average) profit per ad, which is approximately 5.39874 dollars.\n- The yellow dashed line represents the median profit per ad, which is approximately 2.87 dollars.\n- The red dashed line represents the trimmed mean (10%), which is approximately 3.558252 dollars.\n\nA legend on the right side of the image clarifies the color coding of these metrics. The histogram shows a right-skewed distribution, with most data points clustered around the lower profit values, and a few instances of higher profits extending towards the right.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-10-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
