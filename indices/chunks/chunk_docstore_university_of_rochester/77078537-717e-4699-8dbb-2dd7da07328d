By taking advantage of the concept of crowd-sourcing, it is postu- lated that tweets can be analyzed to provide accurate and real-time reports of natural disasters. Because of this, many agencies such as news stations and disaster relief organizations are actively monitoring Twitter for natural disaster reports.\n\nHowever, human speech has an overwhelming amount of complexities that can make it unclear whether a tweet is announcing a real natural disaster or not. These complexities include aspects of speech such as sarcasm, figures of speech/idioms, usage of emojis, etc.[2]\n\nFor example, a twitter user tweeted that the sky was \u201dablaze\u201d, as shown in Figure 1.[3] While it is clear to humans that this is a figure of speech\u2013the Twitter user is not seriously trying to report that the sky was on fire\u2013it can be a challenge for a machine to discern the meaning of the tweet.\n\nFigure 1: Tweet using figure of speech\n\nIn this project, our aim is to build a predictive classification model to discern which\n\ntweets are about real natural disasters and which tweets are not.\n\nPage 1 of 12\n\nJake Brehm \u2022 Josh Wang\n\nUniversity of Rochester\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we will process and analyze unstructured text data from Twitter.[4] The final product of our project could serve as an impactful utility for disaster-monitoring agencies to more accurately monitor the occurrence of natural disasters.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
