In contrast, the counties with the lowest awareness, which have an aggregated mean awareness of zero, include Paulding, Holmes, Champaign, and Highland. The number of people and the overall cases and deaths of the four counties with the lowest awareness are relatively small in Ohio.\n\nFig. 2. The aggregated mean awareness value for each county.\n\nFigure 3 and 4 displays significant variations in the colors of different counties, indicating the severity of COVID-19 infections. Among all the counties in Ohio, Pickaway has reported the most severe infection rates. The five counties with the highest number of per capita COVID-19 cases include Pickaway, Marion, Lucas, Columbiana, and Mahoning. Espe- cially, Pickaway has reported 100 times higher cases per capita than Marion, the second-most affected county. In terms of per capita COVID-19 deaths, Miami, Darke, Columbiana, Portage, and Mahoning are the top five counties. Notably, Columbiana and Mahoning counties are among the top five counties with the highest per capita COVID-19 cases in Ohio.\n\nThe figure 5 illustrates a line chart wherein the x-axis denotes \u201dDays,\u201d and the y-axis signifies the level of awareness computed by averaging the normalized Jaccard awareness scores for each day.
