The interquartile range extends approximately from -5 to 10, and there are several outliers extending up to around 65.\n- For \"yes\" (new customers), the median profit is also close to 0. The interquartile range is slightly narrower, extending from approximately -5 to 5, with outliers reaching up to around 45.\n\nBoth categories have a similar median profit, but the existing customers (\"no\") show a wider spread and more extreme outliers compared to the new customers (\"yes\").", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-16-9.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
