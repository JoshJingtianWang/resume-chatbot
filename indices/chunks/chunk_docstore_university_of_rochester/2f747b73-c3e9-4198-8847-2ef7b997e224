The left box (blue) corresponds to target 0.0, and the right box (orange) corresponds to target 1.0.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report).pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/data mining Final Project (Report)/figure-8-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
