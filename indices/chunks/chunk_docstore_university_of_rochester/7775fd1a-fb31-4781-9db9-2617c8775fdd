INTRODUCTION\n\nThis paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 on the state of Ohio, which has been successful in controlling the spread of the virus through various policies. Our study focuses on exploring the awareness levels of Covid-19-related issues in Ohio, and by comparing different methods and determin- ing methods effectiveness in predicting the daily number of COVID-19 cases in Ohio counties, as well as identifying the most influential factors in the spread of the virus. To achieve this, we employed both machine learning and non-machine learning methods, such as single model and ensemble model techniques, and a rule-based heuristic approach.\n\nII. DATA\n\nB. Dataset\n\nThe present study utilized data derived from tweets and hashtags posted by Ohio residents during the Covid-19 pan- demic and consists of measurements concerning the levels of awareness pertaining to Covid-19-related subjects in each county of Ohio throughout the pandemic period. Additionally, the dataset encompasses information on the count of Covid- 19 cases and fatalities reported on a county level, along with a selection of social, economic, and demographic variables at the county level. Each data point represents the degree of awareness of distinct topics on a given day during the course of the pandemic.\n\nA. Background review\n\nOhio confirmed its first COVID-19 case on March 9, 2020. As of April 6, 2023, Ohio has reported a total of 3,426,822 COVID-19 cases and 42,027 deaths, accounting for 1.22% of the total cases [1]. In terms of the growing trend of the pandemic, Ohio is similar to other states in the US, with a high number of cases and deaths during the winter of 2020, early 2021, and January 2022. Compared to other comparable- sized states nearby, such as Illinois and Pennsylvania, Ohio has reported fewer than one-third of the total cases and deaths, demonstrating a lower impact of the pandemic in the state.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_ohio_project_report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
