Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).\" The chart is divided into 10 distinct topics, each represented by a bar chart displaying the top terms associated with the topic and their respective frequencies.\n\nEach topic is labeled numerically from Topic 1 to Topic 10:\n\n- **Topic 1**: Includes terms like \"regeringen,\" \"vigtig,\" \"enig,\" \"stort,\" and \"tillykke.\"\n- **Topic 2**: Includes terms like \"god,\" \"nieuwe,\" \"jaar,\" \"goed,\" and \"debat.\"\n- **Topic 3**: Includes terms like \"det,\" \"kommer,\" \"mer,\" \"godt,\" and \"ser.\"\n- **Topic 4**: Includes terms like \"dag,\" \"nye,\" \"ja,\" \"norge,\" and \"de.\"\n- **Topic 5**: Includes terms like \"via,\" \"f\u00e5r,\" \"idag,\" \"tak,\" and \"dkpol.\"\n- **Topic 6**: Includes terms like \"sverige,\" \"tack,\" \"plus,\" \"helt,\" and \"europa.\"\n- **Topic 7**: Includes terms like \"bra,\" \"great,\" \"day,\" \"covid19,\" and \"live.\"\n- **Topic 8**: Includes terms like \"amp,\" \"ska,\" \"today,\" \"new,\" and \"takk.\"\n- **Topic 9**: Includes terms like \"g\u00e5r,\" \"onze,\" \"stor,\" \"sypol,\" and \"v\u00e6re.\"\n- **Topic 10**: Includes terms like \"dkpol,\" \"regering,\" \"plan,\" \"vel,\" and \"nya.\"\n\nThe bar charts show the frequency of each term within the respective topic, with the x-axis representing the frequency and the y-axis listing the terms. The terms appear to be in different languages, suggesting a multilingual dataset. The layout effectively visualizes the distribution and prominence of terms within each topic, providing insight into the thematic structure identified by the LDA model.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/kaggle_northern_europe_politician_tweet_project_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/kaggle_northern_europe_politician_tweet_project_report/figure-3-6.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
