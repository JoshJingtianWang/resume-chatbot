The x-axis appears to range from 0 to 15, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 70. The data points are scattered throughout the plot, with a concentration of points near the lower end of the y-axis, indicating a higher density of data points with lower y-values. Some points are more spread out as the x-values increase, suggesting a possible trend or relationship between the x and y variables. However, there is no clear linear or exponential trend visible in the scatter plot.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-26-17.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
