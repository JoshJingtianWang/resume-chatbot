Each scatter plot represents data categorized by seasons: fall, spring, summer, and winter. \n\n- **X-axis (age)**: Ranges from 10 to approximately 60.\n- **Y-axis (profit)**: Ranges from -20 to 80. \n\nThe data points are represented by black dots scattered across each plot. \n\n- **Fall**: The data points are mostly clustered between ages 10 to 50, with profits ranging from -20 to 60.\n- **Spring**: There is a wider range of profit values, with some dots appearing around the 60 profit mark, but most data points are clustered between ages 10 to 50.\n- **Summer**: There is one outlier with high profit, but the majority of data points are clustered in the age range of 10 to 50, with profits mostly under 60.\n- **Winter**: Similar clustering is observed, with some outliers reaching higher profits around age 60.\n\nOverall, the scatter plots show the distribution of profits across different age groups for each season, with some outliers present in each season.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/University of Rochester/computational intro to stats final project report/figure-30-20.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
