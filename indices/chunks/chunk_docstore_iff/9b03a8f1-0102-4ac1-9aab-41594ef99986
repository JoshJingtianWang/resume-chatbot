INTRODUCTION\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances (IFF) is a corporation that produces flavors, fragrances, and cosmetic actives. IFF supplies the chemical additives that it produces to vendors and maintains a centralized Vendor Database in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. IFF has acquired multiple other fragrance suppliers, however, the vendor data from those suppliers come from 45+ different ERP systems with high degrees of variability in language, nomenclature, record structure and completeness, and data quality and veracity. This poses a problem on the accuracy of the representation of the IFF global supply chain.\n\nEntity resolution (ER) is a process that identifies different descriptions that refer to the same real-world entity [1]. Here we use ER to consolidate multiple ERP systems into a single source of truth. Vendor-pair matching is a key step in ER. In vendor-pair matching, Numerical features are engineered by computing matching scores of information such as name, street address, zipcode, tax ID. Then, an ExtremelyRandomizedTrees (ExTraTrees) model is used to predict the match of a vendor pair [2].", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/internship_report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
