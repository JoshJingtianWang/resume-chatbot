The process begins with \"Test Data,\" which is then subjected to a \"Bootstrap\" procedure, generating multiple bootstrap samples.\n\nThese bootstrap samples are used in two branches: \n\n1. Predicting with the \"Old Model\": This branch involves applying the old model to each bootstrap sample to generate prediction scores.\n2. Predicting with the \"New Score\": Similarly, this branch applies the new model to the bootstrap samples, generating another set of prediction scores.\n\nThe prediction scores from both models are then compared using a statistical \"t test.\" The outcome of the t test is the \"t test result,\" which likely indicates whether there is a significant difference between the performance of the old and new models based on the prediction scores.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/internship_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/IFF/internship_report/figure-2-4.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
