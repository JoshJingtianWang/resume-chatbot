Or is it a false positive?\n\nCan we say the new model is worse? Or is it a false negative?\n\nWe need a statistically robust process to compare two machine learning models to avoid \u201cone-off\u201d situations.\n\nIntroducing Bootstrapping\n\nProblem: We cannot count all the m&ms in the factory. We only have a packet of 100 m&ms\n\nSolution: Bootstrapping (sampling with replacement)\n\nObjective: Estimate proportion of m&ms that are red\n\nAdvantages of bootstrapping:\n\nmimicks random sampling\n\nintroduces variability\n\npreserves sample size\n\nOur test data at hand is the m&m packet\n\nBootstrapping allows us to estimate our model performance on the entire population\n\nEstimate proportion of reds with a confidence interval\n\nModel Comparison Process\n\nWhat is a good t test?\n\nWhat is a good t test?\n\nIn our context:\n\nIf the new model is not better than the old model, the t test has a low chance to falsely report that it is \uf0e0 high confidence\n\nIf the new model is indeed better than the old model, the t test has a high chance to correctly report that \uf0e0 high power\n\nWhat is a good metal detector?\n\nDoes not miss any treasure \uf0e0 low false negative rate\n\nDoes not mistake junk for treasure \uf0e0 low false positive rate\n\nsource:\n\nWSJ\n\nModel Comparison Process", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/final presentation.pptx"}, "type": "Document"}}
