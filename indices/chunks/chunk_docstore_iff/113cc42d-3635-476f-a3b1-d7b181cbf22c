CONCLUSION\n\nIn this internship I successfully confirmed the advantage of active learning in the context of Vendor matching in entity resolution. This active learning approach to insufficient training data can be used in other ML tasks where the data is scarce and manual data labeling is expensive.\n\nAs there are currently no open-source ML model com- parison Python libraries available, the iff-model-compare package tackles this issue by providing an automated and\n\nFig. 5.

The combination of the PowerSimulation and ModelCompare modules provides a statistically stringent workflow for data scientists to obtain sufficient test data and evaluate the performance of ML models.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] L.
