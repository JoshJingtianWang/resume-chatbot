The x-axis represents the active learning loop iterations from 0 to 19, while the y-axis shows the accuracy scores ranging from 0.88 to 0.96.\n\nThe chart uses two colors to differentiate between the two learning methods: red for active learning and blue for passive learning. Each iteration has two corresponding bars (one red and one blue) depicting the accuracy scores for both learning methods.\n\nKey observations from the chart:\n- Active learning (red bars) consistently shows higher accuracy scores compared to passive learning (blue bars) across all iterations.\n- The accuracy scores for both learning methods generally increase as the active learning loops progress, with active learning achieving higher improvements.\n- Statistical significance markers (n.s. for not significant and asterisks for significant differences) are placed above the bars, indicating the significance of the differences between the accuracy scores of the two learning methods at each iteration. Some iterations show non-significant differences, while others show significant differences in favor of active learning.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/internship_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/IFF/internship_report/figure-2-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
