Here's a step-by-step summary of the process:\n\n1. **Input Phase**: The user inputs three pieces of information:\n   - Old model score.\n   - Estimated new model score.\n   - Desired statistical power.\n\n2. **PowerSimulation Module**: This module takes the user inputs and calculates the minimum test data size required to achieve the desired power for the t-test.\n\n3. **Data Collection**: Once the minimum test data size is determined, sufficient test data is obtained.\n\n4. **Model Comparison**: \n   - The old model and the new model, along with the sufficient test data, are fed into the ModelCompare Module.\n   - The ModelCompare Module performs a statistically robust evaluation of the two models.\n\nThe overall goal of the process is to ensure that the comparison between the old and new models is statistically significant by adjusting the test data size based on the desired power and effect size. The caption \"Power of the t test increases with test data size and effect size\" highlights that larger test data sizes and greater effect sizes enhance the power of the t-test.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/internship_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/IFF/internship_report/figure-3-6.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
