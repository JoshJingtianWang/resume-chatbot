The majority of the data points are shown in gray, scattered across the plot. There is a decision boundary represented by a diagonal line separating the plot. \n\nHighlighted data points near the decision boundary are colored differently: purple and yellow. The caption and annotation in the image indicate that these highlighted data points are closer to the decision boundary of the classifier. The decision boundary seems to be a critical line that the classifier uses to distinguish between different classes in the dataset.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/internship_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/IFF/internship_report/figure-1-1.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
