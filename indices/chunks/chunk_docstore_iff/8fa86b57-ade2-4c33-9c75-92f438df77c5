In order to compare the updated model with the old model\n\nFor the demonstration of the iff-model-compare package, I used the make_classification function from sklearn.datasets.\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\nA. Active Learning\n\nAs proof of concept, I tested the performance of an active learning model vs a passive learning (random sampling) model. I first started with a logistic regression model on the Titanic dataset. I first trained the logistic regression model on 30% of the available data, 40% was reserved as the \u201cunlabeled pool\u201d, and the rest 30% was reserved as test data. Then I iteratively expanded the training data using active learning or passive learning. For active learning, I used logistic regression\u2019s predict_proba() to sample datapoints closest to 50% as the points closest to logistic regression\u2019s decision boundary. By iteration 5, the active learning model performed significantly better than the passive model in terms of accuracy (Figure 2).\n\nFig. 2. Accuracy scores of logistic regression models trained by active learning vs passive learning. The data was the Titanic dataset.\n\nI also recapitulated the finding using the Vendor-pair data and the ExtraTrees model and similar results were obtained (Figure 3).\n\nFig. 3. Accuracy scores of ExtraTrees models trained by active learning vs passive learning. The data was the vendor pairs data.\n\nB. iff-model-compare Python Package\n\nThe findings from our active learning study led us to think about the process of updating machine learning models: After a new model has been trained, is prediction on the holdout\n\ndataset a sufficient way to evaluate the new model? How do we compare the performance of the new and old models in a more generalizable fashion?", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/internship_report.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
