With uniform random sampling over all of the examples, the learned model doesn\u2019t quite represent the division between classes.\n\nActive learning selects examples near the class boundary, and is able to find a more representative classifier\n\nActive Learning result\n\nIteratively adding new training data by active learning vs random sampling:\n\nActive learning leads to faster performance increase compared to random sampling\n\nProblems in Model Operationalization\n\nEvery time we update the model (with active learning), we need to evaluate the new model against the old model.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/final presentation.pptx"}, "type": "Document"}}
