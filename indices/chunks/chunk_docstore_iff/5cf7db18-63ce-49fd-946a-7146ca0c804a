The process is divided into the following steps:\n\n1. **Predict with Old Model**: This step involves making predictions using an old model. The predictions are represented as scores in blue boxes.\n2. **Predict with New Score**: This step involves making predictions using a new scoring method. The predictions are represented as scores in green boxes.\n3. **T Test**: Both sets of scores (from the old model and the new scoring method) are then subjected to a t-test, a statistical test used to determine if there are significant differences between the two sets of scores.\n4. **T Test Result**: The result of the t-test is then presented, indicating whether the differences between the two sets of scores are statistically significant.\n\nThe flowchart visually represents the process from prediction to statistical comparison.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/ModelCompare.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/IFF/ModelCompare/figure-1-1.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
