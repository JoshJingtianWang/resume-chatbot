Acquiring a larger training dataset is desired, however, manually labeling data is time and resource intensive. To expand our training dataset while minimizing the resources spent on manually labeling new data, we looked at the possibility of active learning [3], [4], [5]. In active learning, unlabeled datapoints are not treated equally. Because some unlabeled datapoints lie closer to the decision boundary of the classifier, they are more likely to help improve the decision boundary (Figure 1). Active learning\u2019s selective sampling helps select the most informative datapoints based on some value metric (in our case, the .predict_proba() method of the ExtraTrees model). Only those selected datapoints are sent to the domain experts for labeling.\n\nII. GOALS\n\nFig. 1. learning. The points are near the decision boundary of the classifier.
