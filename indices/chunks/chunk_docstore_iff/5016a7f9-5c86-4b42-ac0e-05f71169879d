The caption states that the power of the t-test increases with the size of the test data and the effect size.\n\nThe x-axis represents the test data size, ranging from 0 to 1000. The y-axis represents the power of the t-test, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0.\n\nThree lines are plotted on the graph, each representing a different new model accuracy score:\n- Yellow line: New model accuracy score of 0.95.\n- Teal line: New model accuracy score of 0.93.\n- Purple line: New model accuracy score of 0.91.\n\nThe graph shows that as the test data size increases, the power of the t-test also increases for all the new model accuracy scores. The yellow line (0.95 accuracy) consistently shows the highest power, followed by the teal line (0.93 accuracy), and the purple line (0.91 accuracy). This indicates that higher accuracy scores of the new model result in higher power of the t-test, and larger test data sizes also contribute to increased power.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/internship_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/IFF/internship_report/figure-3-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
