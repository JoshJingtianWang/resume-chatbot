The x-axis represents the number of active learning loops (ranging from 0 to 24), while the y-axis shows the accuracy scores (ranging from 0.76 to 0.80). \n\nRed bars represent the accuracy scores achieved by the models trained using active learning, and blue bars represent those trained using passive learning. Generally, the red bars (active learning) display a trend of higher accuracy scores compared to the blue bars (passive learning) across the active learning loops. \n\nNotably, several points along the x-axis are marked with asterisks (*) and \"n.s.\", indicating statistical significance and non-significance, respectively. The asterisks suggest that at those points, the difference in accuracy between active and passive learning is statistically significant.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/internship_report.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/IFF/internship_report/figure-2-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
