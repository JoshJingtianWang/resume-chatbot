Here's a step-by-step summary of the process depicted:\n\n1. **Inputs Provided by User:**\n   - The user inputs the score of the old model.\n   - The user inputs the estimated score for the new model.\n   - The user inputs the desired power for the statistical test.\n\n2. **PowerSimulation Module:**\n   - These inputs are fed into the PowerSimulation Module.\n   - The PowerSimulation Module processes these inputs and outputs the minimum test data size required for the evaluation.\n\n3. **Obtaining Sufficient Test Data:**\n   - With the minimum test data size determined, sufficient test data is obtained.\n\n4. **Model Comparison:**\n   - Both the old model and the new model, along with the sufficient test data, are fed into the ModelCompare Module.\n\n5. **Evaluation Output:**\n   - The ModelCompare Module performs a statistically robust evaluation of the two models and provides the results.\n\nThe flowchart effectively visualizes the sequence of steps involved in evaluating and comparing two models based on user inputs and statistical power considerations.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/IFF/iff-model-compare usage.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/IFF/iff-model-compare usage/figure-1-1.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
