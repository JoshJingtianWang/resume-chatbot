Emma has long, thick fur with a mix of gray and brown shades. She is sitting on a wooden surface, possibly a deck or porch, and is turned slightly to the side while looking towards the camera with wide, alert eyes. In the background, there is a scenic outdoor setting with trees and bushes bathed in soft, natural light, suggesting that it might be either early morning or late afternoon. Additionally, there is a woven chair seen to the right of Emma, adding to the cozy, outdoor ambiance.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Pictures.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Pictures/figure-7-7.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
