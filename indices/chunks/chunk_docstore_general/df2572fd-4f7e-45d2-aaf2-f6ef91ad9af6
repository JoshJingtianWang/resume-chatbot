The cat tree is positioned next to a large window, through which a green tree and a scenic outdoor view can be seen. Emma appears to be sitting on one of the upper platforms of the cat tree, and there is a dangling ball toy attached to the structure. The room has white walls, and a decorative wall light fixture is visible on the right side of the image. The overall scene is bright and appears to be well-lit by natural light coming through the window.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-6-5.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
