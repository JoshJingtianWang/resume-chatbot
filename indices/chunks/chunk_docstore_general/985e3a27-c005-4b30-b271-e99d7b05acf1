Emma has a long, thick fur coat with a mix of light and dark shades. She is looking to the side, seemingly observing something outside. Behind her, through the window, there is a view of a garden with some yellow flowers and greenery. Additionally, there is a potted plant and a bag of what appears to be cat food or treats placed next to her on the windowsill. A soft, green blanket is also partially visible on the left side of the image. The scene suggests a cozy indoor environment with a view of an outdoor garden.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-2-1.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
