Emma is lying down on what appears to be a dark-colored electronic device or a tablet, resting her head on it. Her eyes are open and she is looking off to the side, giving an impression of relaxation or contemplation. Emma has a soft, fluffy coat with a mix of grey and brown fur, and her ears are perked up. The background is plain and minimalistic, ensuring that Emma is the main focal point of the image. There is also a remote control visible in the foreground, placed next to the device Emma is resting on.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Pictures.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Pictures/figure-10-11.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
