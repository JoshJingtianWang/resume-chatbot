Emma is comfortably sprawled out on her back on a plush, light-colored blanket that is draped over a dark leather surface, possibly a chair or sofa. The cat's fur is long and appears very soft, with a mix of grey and white coloration. Emma looks relaxed and content, with her eyes closed and paws partially covering her face, suggesting she is either sleeping or in a very relaxed state. The overall scene exudes warmth and coziness.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-5-4.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
