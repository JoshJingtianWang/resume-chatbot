The central focus is a large, healthy Monstera plant placed in a terracotta pot on a sculptural white stand. The plant's broad, fenestrated leaves are prominently displayed, extending towards a nearby window. Surrounding the Monstera are various other potted plants, including a small fern on a wooden shelf to the left and an assortment of plants in different containers to the right, positioned on a windowsill. The area is well-lit by a black pendant lamp hanging above the Monstera, casting shadows on the wall behind. Additionally, two framed botanical prints rest against the wall under the window, adding an artistic touch to the green-themed decor. The setting exudes a cozy and natural ambiance, enhanced by the presence of these lush plants.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Pictures.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Pictures/figure-23-24.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
