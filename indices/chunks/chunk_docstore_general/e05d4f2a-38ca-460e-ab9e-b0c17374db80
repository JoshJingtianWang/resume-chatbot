Emma's fur is a mix of shades, primarily brown and gray, with some lighter and darker patches. She appears to be sleeping soundly, with her body tightly curled and her head tucked inwards, almost hidden within her fur. The bed she is lying on is plush and soft, with a shaggy, cozy texture, providing a comfortable resting place for her. A hint of a white and black tiled wall can be seen in the background, suggesting that Emma might be indoors, possibly in a cozy corner of the house.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Pictures.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Pictures/figure-3-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
