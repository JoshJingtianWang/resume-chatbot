Emma is seated on a wooden floor in a kitchen. She is a fluffy cat with a mix of gray and brown fur, and she is looking directly at the camera with wide, green eyes. Behind Emma, there is a stainless steel oven with some dark-colored cloths hanging from its handle. To the right, part of a wooden cabinet and a cardboard box are visible. The setting appears to be a well-used, cozy kitchen space.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-3-2.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
