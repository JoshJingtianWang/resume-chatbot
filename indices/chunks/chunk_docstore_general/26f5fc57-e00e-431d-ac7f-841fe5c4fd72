The centerpiece is a large Monstera plant with its distinctive split leaves, placed on a round, pedestal-like stand. To the left, there is a wooden shelf holding another smaller plant in a wooden pot. On the right side, there are more plants, including one in a terracotta pot and another in a decorative rectangular container. The room is softly lit by a black pendant lamp hanging from the ceiling, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The plants are positioned near a window, likely to receive natural light. There are also framed botanical prints leaning against the wall, adding to the room's natural and artistic aesthetic.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-24-24.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
