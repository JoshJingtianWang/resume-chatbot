Emma has a fluffy, medium-length coat with a mix of brown and gray colors. Her facial expression appears somewhat relaxed and slightly squinted, giving her a serene and content look. She is lying on a soft, white surface, which contrasts with her fur. In the background, there is a piece of furniture with a textured, light gray fabric and a dark-colored cat bed or structure. The overall setting suggests a cozy and comfortable environment for Emma.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-9-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
