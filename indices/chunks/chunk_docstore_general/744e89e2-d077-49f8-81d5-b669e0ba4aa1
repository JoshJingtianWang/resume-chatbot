Emma is sitting attentively on a multi-level cat tree, which is covered in a dark, plush material. She has a long, thick coat with a mixture of colors, including shades of brown and gray. Her wide, expressive green eyes are looking directly at the camera, giving her a curious and slightly startled appearance. The background features a large window, through which soft natural light is streaming in, illuminating Emma and highlighting her fur. The scene outside the window is slightly blurred but suggests a tranquil outdoor setting with trees and possibly a fence.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-10-9.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
