Emma is curled up in a cozy, fluffy bed, likely made of a soft material like fleece or faux fur. The cat's fur is a mix of different shades of gray and brown, creating a marbled effect. Emma appears to be sleeping or resting peacefully, with her body tucked in tightly and her head nestled inwards. The background shows part of a white wall and a grid-like structure, possibly part of a crate or enclosure. The overall scene conveys a sense of warmth and comfort, with Emma looking very content and relaxed.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-4-3.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
