Implemented an agentic router and multi-index Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, enabling efficient data retrieval from multiple sources simultaneously. Enhanced chatbot functionality with parent document retriever and chat history-aware retrieval, ensuring comprehensive and context- aware responses.\n\nPredicting Laser Output with Generative AI\n\nImplemented generative models for inertial fusion energy laser systems, focusing on real-time optimization and rapid feedback control. My work involved training a U-Net model and a conditional generative adversarial network to accurately predict laser output, ensuring efficient operation and safety in high-repetition-rate environments.\n\nKaggle Challenge (1st place): Campaign Contributions and Elections in the US (Regression)\n\nEngineered 140 unique features from network datasets. Utilized Pycaret for model selection, while employing Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Achieved first place in the Kaggle Challenge.\n\nEMPLOYMENT\n\nRoblox, Data Science Intern, San Mateo, CA\n\nMay 2023 - Aug. 2023\n\nSlashed analysis time by 99% by developing an automatic root cause analysis tool, reducing time from days to minutes. Enabled 3 teams to adopt the tool after presenting its effectiveness to over 60 colleagues across 4 sessions. Boosted data integrity and cut error resolution time by 90% with a rapid data quality check tool. Built the first dashboard that tracks the usage of Roblox avatar animations, facilitating the shift towards data-informed decision making for the avatar movement team.\n\nIFF, Data Science Intern, Hazlet, NJ\n\nJan. 2023 - May 2023", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/resume.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}}
