The cat has a thick, multi-colored fur coat, with shades of brown and cream. Emma's legs are stretched outward, and her tail is extended. Her head is slightly raised, and she appears to be looking towards the camera. Emma's tongue is sticking out, which gives her expression a playful or relaxed appearance. In the upper left corner of the image, there is a partial view of a brick surface, suggesting that the setting might be an outdoor patio or similar area.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Pictures.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Pictures/figure-15-16.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
