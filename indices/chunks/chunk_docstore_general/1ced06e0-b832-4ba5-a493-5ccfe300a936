Emma is lying down on a soft, light-colored surface, possibly a blanket or bed. She has long, fluffy fur with a mix of light and dark shades, including browns and grays. Emma's ears are perked up, and she has a calm but slightly unimpressed expression on her face. In the background, a piece of furniture, perhaps a couch or chair, and part of a cat tree or similar structure are visible. The overall setting appears to be indoors, in a cozy and comfortable environment.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Pictures.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Pictures/figure-8-8.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
