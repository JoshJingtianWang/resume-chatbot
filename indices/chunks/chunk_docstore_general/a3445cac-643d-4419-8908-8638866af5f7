Emma is looking up, with her mouth open, as a person in the image offers her a treat or a piece of food. The person is wearing a green flip-flop and a bracelet, and is reaching down towards Emma with their hand. The scene is framed by a black metal structure in the foreground, possibly part of a railing or gate. In the background, there is some red mulch and green plants, suggesting the area is part of a garden or patio. The overall setting appears to be a sunny day.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-14-14.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
