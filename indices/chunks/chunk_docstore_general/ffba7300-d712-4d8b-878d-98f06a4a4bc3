My work involved training a U-Net model and a conditional generative adversarial network to accurately predict laser output, ensuring efficient operation and safety in high-repetition-rate environments.\n\nCiti Bike Station Inventory Forecasting (Time Series, Databricks)\n\nExecuted ETL and EDA using PySpark on Databricks for data preparation and optimized a Prophet Time Series model via grid search and cross-validation, tracking and deploying models with MLflow. Created a pipeline adaptable to streaming data, providing visual prediction capabilities.\n\nKaggle Challenge (1st place): Campaign Contributions and Elections in the US (Regression)\n\nEngineered 140 unique features from network datasets. Utilized Pycaret for model selection, while employing Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Achieved first place in the Kaggle Challenge.\n\nClassifying Tweets about Natural Disasters (NLP)\n\nBuilt an LSTM model to predict the authenticity of tweets about natural disasters. Conducted in-depth textual analyses encompassing topic modeling, sentiment extraction, and visualization via word clouds.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nGenerative AI with LLMs (deeplearning.ai)\n\nDec. 2023 - Jan. 2024\n\nUniversity of Rochester M.S.
