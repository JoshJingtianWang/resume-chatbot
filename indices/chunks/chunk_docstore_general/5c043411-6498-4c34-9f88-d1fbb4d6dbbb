The centerpiece is a large, vibrant Monstera plant with its distinctive split leaves, placed in a terracotta pot on a stylish pedestal. Surrounding the Monstera are additional smaller plants, including a leafy plant in a wooden pot on a wooden shelf to the left and several others on a windowsill to the right. The scene is well-lit by a black pendant lamp hanging from the ceiling, casting shadows on the wall, and natural light coming through a nearby window.
