Emma has a grey and brown coat with a mix of light and dark shades. She appears to be looking out the window, while sitting near a green potted plant and a package of what seems to be cat food or treats. The windowsill also has a grey and white textured blanket draped over it. Outside the window, there is a view of some plants and buildings, partially obscured by a mesh screen. The setting appears to be a cozy indoor space with a view of an exterior environment.", "metadata": {"source": "./documents/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang.pdf", "image_path": "./extracted_images/General/Supplementary info for Josh Jingtian Wang/figure-2-1.jpg"}, "type": "Document"}}
